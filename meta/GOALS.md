# Goals

Purpose of this document is to outline our goals around distribution of projects, so we are aligned on what success looks like. This doc should answer questions like:

- Are we OK with lots of business card PCBs being made?
- Are we on track with our goals around more advanced projects?
- What exactly is the difference between a beginner vs. advanced project?

Definitions:

- **Beginner Projects**: Use few components and usually based on existing projects or tutorials
- **Experienced Projects**: Very original, and have multiple components.

Please note that "projects" refers to an individual merged pull request submitting Gerber files to OnBoard. So a single individual could do 1 beginner and 1 experienced project using their $100 grant across 2 PRs.

We aim to have 600 experienced projects and 1,400 beginner projects funded by OnBoard by June 2024.
