# 2023-11-21 RFC for OnBoard grant redesign

_Submitted by @MaxWofford. The following is a request for comments before we make a design change. This is not a final decision, and is subject to change based on feedback._

## Intent

The intent of OnBoard as layed out in our [GOALS.md](./GOALS.md) is to provide an onramp for teens to get into circuitry and to boost teens currently making circuitry projects in our community.

The current way we're doing that is to provide a $100 grant, reguardless of the project. This has led to a lot of hacker card PCBs being made, which a great start for people getting into circuitry, but doesn't help people go further or highlight really unique and interesting projects. Also, in some edge cases people are ordering boards that use up their grant, preventing them from making a future iteration or more complex project.

We want to encourage going further in that journey of making projects _while not lowering the number of beginner projects like the hacker card_.

Examples (each unnamed, but based on real experiences):
- A teen made a hacker card and used up the grant due to enabling a few settings that weren't needed (2-sided assembly, non-economic assembly)
- Someone in the Slack reached out asking if they could make something else than a hacker card, because they were under the impression the grant was just for hacker cards

## Proposal

Now, projects following a Hack Club jam will be funded $50 and are allowed to be copies of other projects. This encourages beginners to still get their foot in the door, while preventing a misclicked "basic assembly" from eating up their grant funds.

All other projects aren't affected by this change. Projects that are not following a Hack Club jam, or remix the jam in a new way will get the full $100 grant.

### Examples & Edgecases

- A teen makes a hacker card PCB. They're approved for $50, and can make another beginner project with the remaining $50.
- A teen who already made a hacker card for $30 wants to make a more complex project. They're approved for the full grant, which is $70 (the leftover that they didn't use with the hacker card).
- A teen remixes the hacker card tutorial, building a doorbell that buzzes on phone tap instead of lighting up an LED. To power their circuit they need to add a battery and a few minor components (capacitors and resistors) to their board. They're approved for the full grant of $100.
