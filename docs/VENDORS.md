# Vendors

This is the list of approved vendors that the HCB grant cards can be used on. To keep the experience uniform for beginners our documentation will still refer to our default vendor, JLCPCB, and we're going to recommend them as the default route. The intent of opening up other vendors is to help people in different areas with different board sizes to find the best price option for shipping.

- [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/): The default vendor.
<!-- add more under this line to suggest a new vendor after reading the directions -->
- [OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/): A US-based vendor with purple PCBs. A bit more expensive, but may be cheaper after shipping.
- [PCBgogo](https://www.pcbgogo.com): Cheaper shipping for UK via Hong Kong post + $50 coupon for first time users.
- [Aisler](https://aisler.net): A EU-based vendor with green PCBs. Pricing per square centimeter. Similar price as other vendors, but faster shipping to EU countries.
- [PCBPower](https://pcbpower.com/): An India PCB Manufacturing company. Better shipping costs and no customs for Indian residents.

> Keep in mind that some international vendors will place an additional customs surcharge after purchasing. JLCPCB generally covers this in their additional fees breakdown (they don't cover customs in India). It's on you to check before ordering because the grant can't cover additional charges like customs.

## Adding to the list

To recommend a vendor for us to reseach, please submit a PR (only 1 vendor per PR) to this list! In general, we can only approve vendors that...

- Only fulfill PCB fabrication (no general vendors like Mouser, Digikey, etc.)
- Provide itemized receipts
- Work with HCB cards

At this time we aren't accepting vendors that provide extra services.

After you submit a PR adding them to the list, the organizers will review the vendor and test to make sure they work with our cards. We may accept or reject the PR based on what we find.
