> SMD, 0603, sot-13, oh my!

There are a lot of strange acronyms and numbers out there. This is a one-stop shop to list some common ones that come up in our [list of ingredients](../ingredients/).

## Sizing

There are [a lot of components](jlcpcb.com/parts) out there. To make it simpler to handle parts, a couple common sizes & shapes for components exist. We aren't going to go over the whole list, but the concept here is that you can easily swap out a component when you're in the final stages of checking out your board. For example, if you need a 1k ohm resistor that's 0603 size, you can just put that in your schematic and choose the cheapest resistor when you order your board.

### 0201/0402/0603

### SOT-13

## SMT vs Through-hole

There are a couple ways to mount a component on a board.

![](TODO: image of through hole resistor)
_Resistor (through-hole)_

![](TODO: image of SMT resistor)
_Resistor (Surface mount, SMD, or SMT)_

### Through hole

- strong connection (good for buttons or switches that you might press hard on)
- sticks out (not good if you want a smooth board)
- easier for hand soldering

### Surface mount

- no wires sticking out
- easier to break off (only glued to the board)
- easier & cheaper for robots to assemble
