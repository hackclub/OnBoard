# Light Sensor

Part number: C72049

<!-- ## Photoresistor

A photo resistor increases its resistance when light shines on it. -->

## Phototransistor

A phototransistor is a [transistor](../tools/transistors.md) that changes its output based on the amount of light shining on it.

### Example:

Here is a reverse night light circuit. When the room is dark the LED turns off. When the room is light the LED turns on.
