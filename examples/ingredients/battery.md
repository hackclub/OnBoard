# Battery power

Batteries are pretty nifty! They have a `+` side (VCC) and a `-` side (GND). You can connect them to your circuit to power it.

The main difference between batteries is their voltage. The most common batteries are 1.5 volts, but you can also get 3 volts, 9 volts, and more. You can also connect batteries in series to add their voltages together.

## Series vs parallel

Sometimes you want to add more batteries to your circuit. There are a couple ways to do this, and they do different things.

If you want to power something that needs more voltage, you can connect the batteries in series, or end-to-end.

If you want the voltage of your line to stay the same, but add extra capacity to your battery by adding more, you can do it in parallel. This means the `+` sides are connected together, and the `-` sides are connected together.
