# Dials

> AKA: Variable Resistor, or a potentiometer

Dials are a type of resistor that can be adjusted to change the resistance. They are often used to control the volume of a speaker, the brightness of a light, or the speed of a motor.

Here's a [simple LED circuit](./led.md#a-single-led) with a dial (R1):

When the dial is turned up, the resistance decreases, and the LED gets brighter. When the dial is turned down, the resistance increases, and the LED gets dimmer.

This specific example's ohm values were tested in [fritzing](../tools/fritzing.md)

Potentiometers have 3 pins, the middle pin is the variable resistance that we can adjust, and the other two pins are connected to the ends of the resistor.
