# Andrew's NFC Card

## Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?

My board is an NFC activated "business card" for myself. When in contact with a phone, it lights up the 2 LEDs (blue and green).

## How much is it going to cost?

After shipping, it costs $29.66.

## Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped?

I followed Maggie's tutorial for the NFC business card. I thought it was a bit too simple so I added another LED and some more graphics. 
I've never done this before so I didn't know if what I was doing was wrong, but I eventually in the end figured out something. I found 
some other EasyEDA tutorials online, so I followed those as well.
