# PROJECT NAME
Andrea's PCB
## Summary
I made a business card with a PCB.
##### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
I followed the Hack Club Jam for PCB making! It has a QR code and all my information on it. It also has an LED light.
## Plan
I designed the card in addition to following the technical parts of the Jam.
##### How much is it going to cost?
It costs $2.00 for 5 cards.

## Design
See Uploaded Files
##### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional***
