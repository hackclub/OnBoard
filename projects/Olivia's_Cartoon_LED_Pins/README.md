# Cartoon LED Pins
## Summary
##### Multiple LED boards that can be easily soldered as a fun little project. Has silkscreen art of game characters and fun cartoony friends!

## Plan
##### The project will probably cost close to 150$ with the components being bought separately from the boards.

## Design
##### I've had a lot of experience in KiCad before so the design process wasn't too difficult. It took some time but I also made all the artwork as vectors in Inkscape. The most difficult part was finding the components to order seperately.
