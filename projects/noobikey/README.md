# noobikey

I want to make a simple, barebones board to run the "pico-fido" project. While this isn't as secure as buying a brand name product like a Yubikey, I wonder about the implications of being able to increase security for lower prices than a Yubikey in a DIY manner. It uses an ESP32-C3 (which was easier to wire than an RP2040 or RP2350, the other two supported MCUs), and the bare minimum needed to get the MCU running.

I used a coupon to get it down to $48.30. The PCBA is economic but uses extended parts.

I used KiCAD to make this.
