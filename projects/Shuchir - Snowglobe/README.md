# Snowglobe

It's a snowglobe! The idea was to make an atypical holiday decoration. For me, the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about PCB-ifying the holidays are christmas trees, and I wanted to do something a little different. Ten neopixels powered by an RP2040 will mimic snowfall, while a buzzer plays christmas tunes. 

It's going to cost ~$30 per piece, or $60 total. (The actual breakdown, also shown in the cart screenshot, is $3.20 for the boards, $40 for assembly, and $18 for shipping). Extended parts were kept to a minimum; the only extended parts were parts in the approved guide (i.e. battery holders), or necessary components like the 5v regulator and the MCU.

As for the challenges, this was my first real pcb; when I did onboard earlier, I either followed a tutorial or didn't really learn much. This one took me a bit of time as I learned about things like decoupling caps, etc. but it was fun overall!
