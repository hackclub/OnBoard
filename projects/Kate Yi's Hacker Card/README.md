# Kate Yi's Hacker Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My PCB board is a personalised business card that can transmit a URL on tap and light up.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$23.51

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
It was challenging to begin as this was my first time tinkering with PCB but following the tutorial helped. I initially connected wires wrongly and made some mistakes but close reading and some patient in troubleshooting helped me pull through.
