# Ivan Business Card
## Summary
##### I have created my own business card following the Business Card workshop created by maggie-j-liu.

## Plan
##### The total cost is $36.86. The production cost is $19.06 and the shipping cost is $17.80.

## Design
##### I used the workshop to produce my business card pcb. Although I have never made a pcb before and that presented the main challenges, the pcb workshop and the ordering guide in the OnBoard github helped immensly resulting in a smooth process.
