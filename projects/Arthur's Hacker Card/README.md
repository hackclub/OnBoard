# Arthur's Hacker Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am making a basic RFID board with some pictures/text on the silkscreen. It has a QR code as well as having various information about me.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It will cost $4.00 without the "special offer" or $2.00 with it.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
