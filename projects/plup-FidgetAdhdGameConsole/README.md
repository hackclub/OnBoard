# plup - fidget game console for kids with adhd

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
my board is an fidget game console for kids with adhd. from my experience as a teen with adhd i find my self most focused at something when i do something else at the same time! but regular fidget toy is just fun , its not really making me do something at them same time
while focusing on something else. so i created game console which uses vibration and basic 3 axis sensor in order to make the game experience easy and not require some looking at the displat or listening to something so you can listen to the class lesson or watching tv while playing game without noticing which help me to focus on the second thing.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
113 usd but i will add 13 usd from my own money its just that the shipping cost is a lot on jlcpcb + i need assembly for 3 board and the 7 usd option is not availble for my components so its 20 usd so it adds up
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
i didnt understand the easyeda software but after some  tutorials i got it.,
Help from: chatgpt flux ai version and a past project knowledge (hope i didnt make any mistakes :) )
