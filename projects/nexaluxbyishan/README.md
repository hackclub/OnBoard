# YOUR PROJECT NAME

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My PCB board is a business card for my youtube channel that encourages people to learn about science. It is a nonprofit running on HCB as well.
I have built this PCB board using the tutorial.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$53.05

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->

I used the tutorial, the presentation deck was very useful. It took me 2 tries to understand it, but the tutorial was great. I learned a lot about PCB design.
