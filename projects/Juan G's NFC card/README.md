I used the great tutorial made by Maggie J Liu (https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card), this pointed me on the direction that i wanted to go, then i changed some things such as the placement of the chips and the LED used.
The led was originally supposed to be purple but due to stock issues it had to be white (not a big problem anyways), after this came the design part, i got inspired by the tutorial and wanted to make a pattern like texture,
Here is where i found my first trouble on this project (How do i make a pattern texture??) after looking online i learnt about svg files and the wonderful world of converting back and forth but i was able to do, and in the end it came the way i wanted to!
In general i say that learning about PCBs, SVGs and everything else in betweeen was a good experience and something that i keep looking forwards to.

PD
In case someone is looking through here and needs some help with the texture part, down below are the steps that i did to make mine:

Find the item/items that you want to make a pattern of and save them as PNG or JPG

Use a convertor from what you saved as to SVG (i used this one(PNG to SVG): https://convertio.co/png-svg/)

To edit the SVG files i used Canva with canva i was also able to make the pattern

After that i downloaded as PNG (you can download as SVG and skip the next steps but you have to be a member of canva plus)

The convert to SVG again and you are done!

Enjoy your texture
