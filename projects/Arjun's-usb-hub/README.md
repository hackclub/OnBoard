# Arjun's USB Hub

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My Project is a USB Hub that splits one USB port into 4 seperate connections. Each USB port can convey both data and power. 
The Hub has the phrase "Arjun's USB Hub" written on it.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The cart screen shows a cost of $109.86, However, I have a New customer coupon that 
takes the cost down to $97.86. The coupon only displays when you press Pay.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
One challenge was turning the schematic into the final PCB. I decreased this challenge by using auto-trace numerous times to make sure my
connections were all clean and no short-circuits could arise.
