# YOUR PROJECT NAME

My board consists of an rfid/nfc scanner (antenna and tuner design from [this](https://www.adafruit.com/product/364) adafruit product), a lcd display (for feedback to the user), and an esp32. 
It's designed to be used for tracking attendance at our clubs meeting, but could be modified for other purposes.
Its going to cost ~$130 for assembly at JLCPCB, and it will probably be another $40-60 for other parts JLCPCB cant supply (from somewhere like digikey or mouser, I'm glad my schools paying for the extra lmao)
