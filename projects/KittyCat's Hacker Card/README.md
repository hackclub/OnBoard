# KittyCat's Hacker Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is my hacker card that I made using the Hacker Card Jam. It has an nfc chip and will able to transfer data to a device. I'm thinking of putting my personal site on it so that when a device taps it, it will redirect to my website.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$22.52

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
