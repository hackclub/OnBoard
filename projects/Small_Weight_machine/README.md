# Weight Machine

## Summary

I am trying to make a weight machine contained in a PCB, that can be used as a Scale.

## Plan

I plan to order the 5 pcbs from JLCPCB, which quotes them at a total of 4 dollars. 
I then plan to purchase 5 assembeled PCBs, and each one costs around 17 dollars.
I'll also need some headers and buttons, which will be around 2-3 dollars. 
So, adding in costs for switches, assembly, and shipping, total cost is about 98.86 dollars.

## Design

I was inspired after seeing the video provided in the table and followed the methodology for inspiration and designed my own PCB using the pictures that he provided.
