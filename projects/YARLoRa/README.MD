YARLoRa

An RP2040-based board with a LoRa radio and a BLE 5.2 module. Intended for use with a mobile phone application for LoRa transmissions.

Cost: ~$77.71 including shipping

This was my first proper PCB design, meaning it required a significant amount of learning in the process. Also getting components to match JLCPCB is a pain, I'll still have to buy and solder the LoRa module myself since they don't have it.
