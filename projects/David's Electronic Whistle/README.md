# YOUR PROJECT NAME
Electronic Whistle
<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This circuit is board is for an experimental electronic whistle which I am trying to build for my schools so that they can use it for Sports lessons as a
more hygenie alternatives to traditional whistles. It uses a STM32 microcontroller at the heart to generate the Middle C tone for the Passive Buzzer on the 
edge of the board. This will be powered by a 9v battery and 5v regulator built into the circuit board. I plan to create a housing out of some flexible 3d 
to be able to withstand a harsh school environment.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The circuit board will cost around $5 AUD and the components cost around $40.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
