# **Sahil_Dasari_NFC_Business_Card**
## Summary
##### Im making a Pcb Board (round rectangle). It has a QR code to my all about me website and has a LED on the I in my first name.

## Plan
##### It will cost around $60 and 3-7 days.... All the info is on the **cart.png**

## Design
##### I started watching maggie make her PCB. A challange was getting pictures on the PCB because i kept getting **ðŸ˜“NO path-tags found** error. Exporting the QR on figma as a svg helped.
