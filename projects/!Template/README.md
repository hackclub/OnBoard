# Template
Hey there! This is a template for what you'll need to upload to GitHub to receive a grant for OnBoard!

Everything should reside in `onboard/projects/YOUR-PROJECT-NAME`. 

Items that must be included:
- [ ] `Gerbers.zip`: This should be the file that you send off to JLCPCB.
- [ ] `JLCPCB.png`: A screen shot of JLCPCB approving your board
- [ ] Design files (`design.json`, `design.sch`, `design.brd`, etc). Whatever format your designer outputs to should be included. If using easyEDA, make sure to export the `design.json` of both your schematic and PCB.
- [ ] `README.md`: A filled out [`TEMPLATE.md`](./TEMPLATE.md), renamed to `README.md`
