# PILOT v3

New more robust version of v2 and 1, it has a voltage regulator and rather than having an always on led I connected the led to one of the pins on the AT tiny.
It also now has decoupling capicitors and the reset pin is wired correctly.

2 bucks because I already have the parts but I bought a stencil for 7 bucks to make it easier to solder
