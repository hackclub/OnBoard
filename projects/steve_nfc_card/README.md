# PROJECT NAME
## Summary
##### I'm buidling an NFC business card. It will be similar to Maggie's build. This project will teach me the very fundamentals of NFC and PCB engineering.

## Plan
##### It will cost me $2. Once the PCB is delivered, I will try to make the NFC become compatible with my arduino's RFID chip. Once they become compatible, when the ardino senses the info, it'll send a message to an RPI server which will be connected to my phone and open my custom website.
