<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I'm making a hardware board to control Spotify. It takes 5 standard MX keyboard switches and a 16 char / 2 line LCD and connects them to a Raspberry Pi Zero. It requires no soldering for the Zero, since the GPIO headers on the PCB are male the Zero can just sit on top of them.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It costs $82.21 at JLCPCB after shipping and assembly.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I designed this board in Kicad. I've never designed a PCB before and instead opted to do solderless approaches to things for as much as possible, but my current prototype just has too many wires to make sense. It took me a while to master the software, but with some tutorials and some assistance from friends who've done this kind of thing before, I feel like it would be much easier for me to design a board again sometime.
