# Occula Zero (Control Board)

I've been working on making a point-and-shoot camera with a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. Being a camera, it needs a shutter button and a status light. When soldering wires and components at home, I have found it to be janky and to break a lot. I decided to design my first PCB without using a tutorial, so I made this!

It should cost $21.54.

I used EasyEDA to design it. I had a bunch of troubles finding the parts I needed, but as I went further with making the board, it got easier. I found that checking the stock of the components was good to do before putting it on the design! I got some help from Sneako in the Slack, which I really appreciate!
