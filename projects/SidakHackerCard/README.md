# SidakHackerCard

Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? 
-> I will use the bored us to promote myself as a software engineer and maybe get an internship; the market is bad 

How much is it going to cost? 
-> $53.95

Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? *** optional*** 
-> It was straightforward till my laptop could not run the 3d view, the pick and place file was not importing, and had to restart in the online editor because the desktop version did not have the correct antenna with a footprint.
