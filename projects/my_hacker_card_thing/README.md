# Hacker Card NFC Thing

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
It's a sort of business card that has NFC embedded into it, it has my email and phone number on it. The NFC tag will share a link to somewhere. In the version I attached to the PR, it doesn't contain my contact details; I just attached some boilerplate
stuff as instructed from someone in the Slack; the version I submitted to JLCPCB contains my details.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$30.12

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I couldn't decide what I wanted on it, so I just settled for starwars stuff; I've never used PCB design software before and so learning how to do it was a lot of fun.
