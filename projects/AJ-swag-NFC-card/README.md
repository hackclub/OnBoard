# AJ's swag NFC business card

This is a simple business card with NFC functionality made with a Hack Club tutorial.

This will simply be used to tell others about my skills as a web developer and other things.
<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The total cost of 2 pcb cards will be $43.41 since the pcb itself is $2 (with some special offer I can't get rid of), the assembly for the pcb is $20.45, the estimated shipping is around $30.96, and I have a coupon for $10 off my order.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
