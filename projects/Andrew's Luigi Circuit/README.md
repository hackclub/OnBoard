# Andrew's Luigi Circuit

I am making a 555 Timer that will light up 10 LEDS in order. I made this board to look like Luigi and I put a hole, so that I can wear like a pin on my jacket.

It will cost $27.82

I loved wiring this small ~81mm by ~61mm board as it was a challenge and somewhat a game to figure out how to carefully map every wire.
