# PCB CARD

I am building a PCB Card for a workshop at STEM Club at Markham District High School. The card will send a link to my linktree when the card detects a phone. 

$27.77

We had a presentation at school where some club executives talked through the design steps, showed us what parts to use, what documents to refer to, and went around to see who needed help. Nothing was really challenging, it was just kinda slow because of how many people had signed up for the workshop compared the workshops last year.
