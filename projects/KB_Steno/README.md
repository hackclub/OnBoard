# Stenography Keyboard

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I'm creating my second keyboard PCB, this time it will be in a different layout. Stenography keyboards are focused on faster and more efficient typing, and I want to 
try it out!
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Total will be close to $50 - I have about $30 left in my OnBoard grant and I will cover the rest myself.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I followed a similar process as before, but this time I decided to have a footprint for the microcontroller in the center to make it easier on myself when soldering. The 
layout is also a bit wacky, but It looks pretty cool! I also experimented with the soldermask more this time, adding special text and even images.
