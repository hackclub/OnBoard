# Project Name
ESPAudio

## Summary
I made a board which can show what is currently playing on your Spotify account, and also control the volume of it and control what song is playing. It utlizes an ESP32 to connect to the Spotify API, and will display what is playing on a color LCD, along with being controlled with buttons.

## Plan
Once I recieve the board, and I solder it, I plan on writing the code for it.
It will cost $3.53 for 5 boards, and $21.33 total with shipping

## Design
Using KiCAD, I designed the schematic and PCB Layout with all the features I want the board to have. The board has two options for power: either USB or battery, for which it has an onboard charger with the TP4057. It also has a color LCD screen, to display an image of the song currently playing, and buttons on the side to control what's playing.
