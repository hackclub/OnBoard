# Skyfall's Hacker Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is an NFC enabled hacker card. You can scan the card with your phone and it'll light up an LED and take you to my site.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The card will cost $3.50 with shipping, but I will probably make a few variations of the design and check if everything works.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
