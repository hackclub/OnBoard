# I2C LED Matrix

It is a printed circuit board based on the adafruit charlie plex circuitry which I designed on my own and laid it out all on a PCB which I can get designed by a professional supplier.

It costs about 90$ with shipping and all the 5 boards come pre assembled as shown in the picture attached inside the repository. As Everything comes assembled nothing more is needed, you could also take extra 5-10$ for the microcontroller to run this from, which I have laying around already.

It is a 4 Layer Board which was traced manually on 4 layers and took a lot of time. It sure does has a lot of drc errors but they are very minor and easy to work out. However, I took out additional 5-6 hours to try my best to remove the majority of them.
