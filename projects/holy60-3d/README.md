# Keyboard PCB

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is a Keyboard PCB that helps mechanical keyboard builders everywhere! Instead of handwiring each
key meticulously, all you have to do is solder switches onto the pcb and solder a controller and you're done!
In the future, I might also add some RGB/backlight to make it have a more polished and customizable look/feel.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$65.53 for this iteration (without tax I believe)

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I started with a youtube guide by Joe Scotto to get used to KiCAD and all the different keyboard libraries that exist. He helped 
me understand the fundamentals and I was able to apply his macropad design to a much larger scale. I initially wanted to create a 
keyboard with an embedded MCU, which I actually did design, but I was unable to find parts for on JLCPCB and didn't want to assemble 
myself because I don't know surface mount soldering (yet :). The guides defeinitly helped me design this keyboard and the people in the 
#electronics channel on the HC slack (shoutout to Adam Turaj!) helped me perfect and make sure everything was good to go!
