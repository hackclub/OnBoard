# RPI-Pico WS2813B LED board

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is a little LED board to learn about PCB design and make a functional ordnament. I've included mounting holes so I can use it anywhere with a power source.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The PCBs are $3.30 CAD for five, but assembly brings it up to $73.68 CAD for five. I aim to better my soldering skills to make my assembly cost significantly cheaper.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
This started from an idea for how I could cover my very empty back wall. I realized quickly after learning a bit about PCB design (and the costs) that such a large project, even if broken down into smaller pannels, 
would be well out of my price range and skill level. With this in mind, I instead decided to combine my love for the wonderful little board that is the Raspberry Pi Pico with my newfound interest in these LEDs. 
Armed with my limited electronics knowlege and a will to make things, I took to KiCad's tutorials to start making this, and from there it was relatively smooth sailing. I found the whole process quite fun, and I really
hope to do this again!
