# Rocket Airbrake Avionics PCB
<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This board will control an airbrake on a 3D printed rocket for the American Rocketry Challenge. Using redundant pressure sensors, it will calculate it's velocity and altitude to estimate apogee. Using this estimation, it will determine wether or not it needs to slow the rocket down using the airbrake, to lower the projected altitude to meet the target altitude. 

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
This is going to cost $96.86

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I based my board off of other similar PCBs from Sparkfun and Adafruit to design a fully incorporated PCB using all the parts I was already familiar with. Some challenges was routing the PCB, as it's fairly complex and required many connections between all the components.
