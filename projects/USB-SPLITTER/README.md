# USB-SPLITTER

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I created design for a USB-HUB. It will help me organise my table, by directing all of my wires into one place.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The cost is near 50usd
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The hardest part was organising the wires ontop of the hub.
