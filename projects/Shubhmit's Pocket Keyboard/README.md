# Shubhmit's Pocket Keyboard

Hey Everyone,
I am building a mini pocket keyboard which go straight into my cyberdeck porject which I have been working on since past few months and it is also powered by Raspberry Pi

I am going to keep it cheap at just around $50-$60

So, it is a two layer PCB which consist of an embedded Atmega32u4 which will be programmed with a custom bootloader. it also consists of a 5 way switch and 70 pushbuttons. :D
