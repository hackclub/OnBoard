# Codex Scope

<!-- Board Description / What is it supposed to do / What am I making-->
The board uses a Raspberry Pi Pico to power an RA887 TFT Display Driver board, with holes on the pads to have the pins easily accessible for hardware add-ons. Also includes a small LED to indicate that the TFT board is receiving power.
I am making a PCB to be used in a device to teach electronics to members of my club, making a sort of learning device to allow members to experiment with coding with electronics.  
I am also going to use this PCB to learn about display processes for nice graphical interfaces and build my low-level arcade games from scratch on it with the Raspberry Pi Pico and display.

<!-- How much does it cost? -->
$18.79

<!-- Design Process: What helped, What challenges? -->
Some challenges I faced were going back in forth in between creating a schematic then laying out all the wires since I'd realize I wanted to change the schematic after laying the parts out. It was also a whole new experience figuring out how to 
do simple things such as adding pads. Another challenge was the patience required to lay out all the text for the pins. In the end, I do believe that, although this PCB is extremely simple, I learned a lot about how PCBs are made, and I feel more comfortable to
make a PCB in the future.
