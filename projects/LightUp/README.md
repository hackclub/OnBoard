# YOUR PROJECT NAME

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
A little LED matrix to make a cool keychain! I will need to add a esp32 and other parts to make it functional, but the leds are what I need.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It will cost ~ $54 but taxes, duties, and shipping will cost quite a lot. 
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The problem with this pcb is that the components are not compatible with economic PCB, meaning that I had to use PCBA making the cost much higher than expected. The LEDS are also quite hard to wire up in the editor, as there are 100 of them and they are small.
