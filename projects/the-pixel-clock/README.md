# The Pixel Clock

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

This is a clock-shaped holiday ornament (which unfortunately cannot function as a clock). It's powered by 2 LIR2032 batteries, and runs on an 8051 CH552 MCU. It has a buzzer which can be used to play songs, with the 8 neopixels flashing in sync.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

## Cost

$31.72 + $18.15 shipping - $9.00 coupon = **$40.87**

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->

## Design Process

There's not much information on the CH552 online, so figuring out what its voltage/current requirements and capabilities were as well as figuring out how to program it was difficult.
