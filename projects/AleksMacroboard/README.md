# Aleks Macroboard

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This pcb will house a 3x3 macroboard with a rotary encoder to enable me to speed up workflow whether it be for school or for CAD. It is powered by a pi pico. 

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
My last project cost me $29.63. This project (with a coupon!) will cost $66.15 putting me right around the total $100 budget.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Having watched some of ScottoKeebs' videos in the past, I decided to reference his guide to PCB design for keyboards using a matrix layout. 
To challenge myself I decided to add a rotary encoder and decided to package it in as small of a config as possible. I will be designing a
case for it in Onshape very soon!
