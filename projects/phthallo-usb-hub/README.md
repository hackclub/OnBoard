# Dual USB Hub

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is a USB hub with two USB-A connections, made as part of the USB Hub jam. I will likely attach my Bluetooth mouse and Arduino cable to it.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It will cost $33.57.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
It was my first time actually delving into electronics (excluding *very* basic Arduino usage) and definitely was a bit challenging, but I enjoyed it! I'll have to solder the primary USB-A connection myself though because JLCPCB raised the assembly fee for it :/
