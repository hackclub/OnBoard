# Abhilash's PCB NFC Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I'm making my very first PCB as a NFC business card. It has a picture as well as a QR code and some text (my email, GitHub username and a link to my website). 

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It's going to cost a total of $34.99.
The breakdown: 
- $20.12 for a total of 5 PCBs/Cards
- $12.69 for shipping
- $2.18 as sales tax
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
There was [a wonderful tutorial made by Maggie J. Liu](https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card) available for me to use. Having to constantly flip back between the windows of the guide and the EasyEDA website made me misclick a few times, but looking up documentation for the software made me learn a lot more about it, PCBs in general and how to fix the problems I created.
