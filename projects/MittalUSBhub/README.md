# 4 way USB Hub

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
this board is a usb hub that will extend the amount of usb-A ports I have on my computer so I can connect more things to it at the same time.
I need this because my computer only has 2 usb ports be default and hubs are kinda expensive so I thought it would be cool to make one myself.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? --> $33.76 AUD

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
One challenge was trying to find through hole versions of all the parts in the tutorial. I looked for about an hour before 
finding out that JLCPCB does an assembly service.
