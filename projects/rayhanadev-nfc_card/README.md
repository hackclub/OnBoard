# Hacker Card

## Summary
I followed the tutorial Maggie made and then experimented with it to make it interesting ðŸ˜†.

## Plan
I'm mostly making these so I have material to present at a lab in a couple of weeks for our first couple of Hack Club meetings!

The board costs $3.10 and assembly costs $17.69. I opted to have all the boards shipped pre-assembled because I don't have soldering tools on hand.

## Design
I tried a couple of different designs and layouts before eventually deciding on some confetti silkscreen and copper designs. In accordance with the rest of my branding/design, I also uploaded and used Victor Mono.
