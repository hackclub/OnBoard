# 555 LED Chaser

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am making a generic LED chaser using a 555 timer. The board will make ripples of light with 10 LEDs that turn on and off in synch with the 555 timer.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$33.20
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Figuring out the component footprint and supplier parts was the hardest part of this design.
