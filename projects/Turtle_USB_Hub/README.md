# YOUR PROJECT NAME

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
For my onBoard project, I wanted to make a USB hub since I'm running low on ports on my laptop. 
I also wanted to make the PCB in the shape of a turtle because the USB parts that are sticking out from the PCB reminded me of legs and the green color of the PCB reminded me of a turtle.
In summary, I am making a 4-port USB hub to allow for my laptop to have extra ports!
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
In total my boards will cost $40.40
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I had a challenge with getting the parts I needed since the ones I had selected were out of stock. I spent some time looking at turtles and tortoises to get the shape of my PCB. The tutorial from hack club 
gave me a basic idea of how to make a PCB and I think without it I would be lost!
