# NFC HackerCard PCB

- I am making a NFC HackerCard PCB that allows people to scan it and allow people to know about my details.
- It will cost $29.18.

- 
In my design process for the NFC HackerCard PCB, I focused on simplicity and functionality, ensuring that anyone could easily scan the card and access my details. One of the key challenges was balancing the size of the PCB with the necessary components, all while keeping the cost low. Integrating the NFC technology also required attention to signal strength and antenna design.
What really helped was leveraging existing open-source NFC libraries and PCB design tools, which allowed me to quickly prototype and iterate. Feedback from the maker community also gave me valuable insights and helped refine the final design.
