# Hacker Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I made a circuit board the size of a credit card to act as my business card. It has my name and character on it, and when you hold it up to an NFC reader, it will transmit a link to my GitHub profile.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The order is going to cost $30.78 total.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I followed the Hacker Card Jam to make the basic design and layout, and I also added a picture that represents me.
While following the tutorial, I had trouble figuring out whether to use a multi-layer pad or a via to connect the antenna to the NFC chip.
After some through research on the differences between pads and vias, I decided that vias would most likely work for the card.
