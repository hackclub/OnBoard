# LucidVR Prototype 5 Haptic Gloves Controller Board
I built a control PCB for [LucidVR](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves) Prototype 5 VR haptic gloves.  
It is designed for easy building with Dupont connectors and contains a status LED, calibration button, 5 servo connectors, 5 combined finger hall effect sensors, and USB-C power delivery.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The board itself is inexpensive to make, but I decided to go with the JLCPCB assembly service which adds a significant amount to the total -- about $40. The board, including shipping and after coupons, costs $50.52 to order.
