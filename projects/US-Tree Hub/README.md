# US-Tree Hub

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
The US-Tree Hub is a very well-rounded PCB! Not only is it a gorgeous decoration for your home, you can also use it as a USB Hub. 
You can plug it into any power socket around your home, along with a power brick, and be amazed at it's bright LEDs! 
In fact, if you have a power bank, you can use that as a battery to power the Christmas tree, thus making it portable. 
And if you want to save energy, you can turn the LEDs on and off with the built-in switch.
On top of that, the USB hub functionality allowes you to be reminded of the spirit of Christmas whenever you connect some devices to it!

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
According to the cart.png picture, around $57.03.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
At first, I wanted to make a more complex Hub including an ethernet port and an SD-card reader, but with the deadline approaching and realising the difficulty of the task, I scaled it back to a USB Hub in the shape of a Christmas tree with LEDs decorating it. 
It even has one LED at the tip of the tree, as a cherry on top :)
