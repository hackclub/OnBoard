# Yet Another USB-A to USB-C Adapter Board

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My board is a USB-A to USB-C adapter. It allows you to plug in a USB-C device, and connect it to a computer that only has USB-A.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The total cost after shipping is $73.27.
The bare PCB itself only will cost $11.80 before shipping.
The majority of the total cost is from the assembly, which will cost $48.96 before shipping and tax.
Shipping itself is estimated to cost $12.51
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I started out by making the design in KiCad. After I had fully done the traces, I realized that I did not leave enough cleaance for the cables to be plugged in to the ports.
I then fully redesigned the PCB, in EasyEDA this time. That is the design I am submmitting here.
