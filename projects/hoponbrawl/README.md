# YOUR PROJECT NAME

This is an NFC card that opens up brawl stars. I wanted to make this because it's currently a popular game and I could tap it on my friends phone and mine, it would be cool. It follows the tutorial.

$28.11 with coupons, which falls into the rest of my grant.

I used the black pcb as the outline for brawl stars which I thought was neat, it was pretty good.
