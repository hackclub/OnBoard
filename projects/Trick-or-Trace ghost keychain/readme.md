# Ghost keycahin

This is a project I made for trick or trace and is a ghost that you can use as a keychain.
It has a bettery connector and green lightup led eyes.
If you press the button on its nose it mades a lound noise to scare away your friends.


It will cost $4.53 USD

I wanted to make something spooky for trick or trace and was just messing around to find something that looks good until I found this.
(also I dont really want to spend my funds on this, I just wanted to do trick or trace for the stickers)
