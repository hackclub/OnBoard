# NFC BUSINESS CARD

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I followed a tutorial to create an NFC-enabled business card using PCB design software. Tapping the card with a smartphone instantly redirects to my online portfolio, offering a unique way to share contact information.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It's Going to Cost $31.10 according to JLCPCB
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I spent a lot of time in the design phase, experimenting with different layouts and features to create a visually appealing and functional NFC-enabled business card.
