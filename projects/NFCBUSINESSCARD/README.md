# NFC Business Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I'm making an NFC business card. If it works as intended, it will allow me to add information to the card whenever I want so that if needs my information for any reason, I can just tap the card to their phone.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The base price is 19.72 without shipping and taxes. With shipping and taxes, it costs 39.39. With shipping, taxes, and $10 off promo code it costs 28.90
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
