# nfc-cat-card

This board will harvest energy from a phone it connect to with the nfc chip, and will send a link to my portfolio to it. Also, a led red 
light next to the club of jacks (not a real card I know) will light up while it scans.

$21.98

The challenges I faced were DRC......I hate drc errors. Thank you to all the amazing minds that helped me!
