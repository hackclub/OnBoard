# ESP8266 Shield NFC Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is a shield for an esp8266 Huzzah Feather from Adafruit. I am using this as a business card that can attach to an esp8266 that I own. It has NFC and can light up with addressable LEDs that I am going to solder on.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$44.94 for the assembly of the backside and the PCB. 
I am using my own LEDs for the front side, and my own esp8266.
