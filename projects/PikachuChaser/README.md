# Pikachu Chaser

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
The board uses a decade counter to sequentially enable leds based on the clock signal, provided by a 555 timer circuit, with variable frequency based on
the potentiometer on board. The power is supplied by either a USB C or another 5V power source. A very basic starter project.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
approximately 34 dollars + tax and shipping
