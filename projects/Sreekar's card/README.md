# PCB Hacker Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My board will have all the functions of a normal business card, but it has an NFC chip and antenna, so when held to a phone it will transmit certain data such a URLs or contact information. It also has a ruler and a QR code that can be changed whenever, even after the board is shipped.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
## Price:
$20.16 merchandise total + $8 shipping for a total of $28.16
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
