# 8x8 Charlieplexed LED Matrix

A small board containing 64 LEDs, Charlieplexed to work with 9 pins.
Powered by the Maxim Integrated MAX6951 IC.
To be controlled via a microcontroller (Arduino) over SPI.

Ten boards are being ordered, plus shipping, at a cost of $47.00 (coupon included). Parts that need to be pre-ordered cost an additional $15.42 for a total cost of $62.42.

I used a lot of references, and reread the datasheets a lot. Here's to hoping it works!
