# Aaryav's Linux Console

It is a board that is powered by the All Winner F1C100S which is a total package having RAM also built in. Literally perfect for a linux board

This is very cheap as in just under 85$ you can get 5 of them assembled!!

Working with the F1C100S was fairly difficult for me because of the limited sources but after trial and error I finally could produce the design
