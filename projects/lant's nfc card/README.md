# lants objekt (based off the kpop group "ARTMS") nfc card


# summary
It's a really simple NFC PCB, based off maggie liu's tutorial that i linked in the header! the design is based off the "objekts" for the k-pop group ARTMS.

# price
It's gonna cost 36.51$, if you include the 10$ shipping off coupon on JLCPCB.

# design
for the design process of the PCB i just followed what maggie liu did in her tutorial, i tried making a faithful recreation of ARTMS' objekt in photoshop, and then imported it into EasyEDA. it took a while to get it to look the way i wanted it to but im really happy with the way it came out!
