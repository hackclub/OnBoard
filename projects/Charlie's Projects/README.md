# Charlie's projects

I'm actually ordering seven + one of my friends at once to save money, so here they are:

- LittleLoRa v1.0 - LittleLoRa is a LoRa based GPS tracker that can last days off a single AAA transmitting location every minute. LittleLoRa takes advantage of ham bands. https://github.com/crnicholson/LittleLoRa
- StratoSoar MK2.0 - StratoSoar is a high altitude autonomous glider which uses a DIY autopilot system to fly and again can last a day off a single AAA battery. It is tracked by LittleLoRa. https://github.com/crnicholson/StratoSoar-MK2
- Soldering practice board - I volunteer at a local makerspace, and everyone is always asking how to do SMD soldering, so I created this nifty little board just for that.
- USB-C breakouts - I needed to make some breakouts for USB-C breadboard prototyping. I also made some that use the PCB pads as the entire receptacle, saving money.
- MPU-9250 breakout - These are pretty common, but I wanted to make one with the same 4 layer stackup as StratoSoar.
- TPS61200 breakout - This is a boost converter, and let me tell you, I spent hours greiving over the perfect layout so as not to induce noise onto the rest of my circuit.
- Si4063 breakout - This is an awesome radio chip, with no Arduino libraries or other breakouts (AKA lots of fun staying up too late).
- Tiny4FSK - This is a board created by my friend that I'm ordering for him to save on shipping costs. It is similar to LittleLoRa, but instead uses the 4FSK modulation protocol (again, ham radio). https://github.com/New-England-Weather-Balloon-Society/Tiny4FSK

These projects are going to cost a total of $66.72, with $45 worth of board and $17.80 worth of shipping.

The hardest part was making super complicated SMD boards with all the components so close together. And the RF design SUCKED.
