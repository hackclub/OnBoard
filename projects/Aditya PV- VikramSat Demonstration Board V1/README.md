# VikramSat Demonstration Board V1
This a technology demonstration board for the CubeSat I'm building. It contains all key components that will fly to space. This board will help to validate the capabities of the components.

Cost: 61.19$

Designing this was quite challenging and quite an experience. Every single component had to be tested rigorously before being decided to be used on the board. Designing this board certainly did teach me a lot about reiterating and improving upon things. I'm thankful to Hack Club for giving me this opportunity.
