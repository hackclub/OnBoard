# VISIT CARDS 2.0

I would like create my visit card in a digital format. This format is like a credit card with a NFC system. It will be ecofriendly 

The price of the product is 90.08 $ with the shipping and tax

I don't know electronic and it was a real challenge for me to find the components and how to design my visit card. I've found helped with google and my family.
