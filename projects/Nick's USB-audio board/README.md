# USB to Aux Converter

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This board is meant to take a USB signal in and use the PCM2706C chip to output an AUX signal. It uses a 3.3v regulator to minimize noise, and some nice looking capacitors for good filtering.
I hope to use this in my car and at home, since my PC has awful noise isolation.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The boards themselves are ~$3 and assembly brings the total up to $57, with FedEx shipping (to avoid customs) making the total $67.57.
For future revisions of the board I can drastically save on cost by re-using components, the main expense.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I started with this idea because of my car's lack of wireless phone connection. When travelling with friends, it was troublesome to play songs we want since almost all modern phones don't have the aux input my car takes.
Initially I wanted to also make this a USB fast charger too, plugging into the cigarette lighter port, but that turned out to be prohibitively expensive, and very challenging on the technology side. 
I built this with Hack Club Arcade, which has been very fun!
