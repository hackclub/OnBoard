<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am making a simple USB 2.0 Hub to connect mouse dongles, microcontrollers and the likes to my laptop. </br>
It will be a simple 4 port USB hub. </br>
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
According to JLCPCB the order total is â‚¬44.59
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I was following the tutorial on the Hack Club website at first, but at somepoint along the road thought, why not make it a 4 port. </br>
This deviates from the tutorial in the sense that it has 4 ports as opposed to the tutorial's 2 ports. </br>
I looked into making it USB 3.0 capable/compliant, but that is a rabbit hole I wasn't willing to go down while I was boiling in the Italian summer heat. </br>
This is something that I might do in a furture revision (and maybe it will even be USB 4.0 compliant). </br>
