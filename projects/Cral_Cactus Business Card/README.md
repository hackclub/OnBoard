# Cral_Cactus' Business Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is NFC Business Card. It have a cactus with crown because my username Cral_Cactus means King Cactus so that cactus with crown represent my username. Also there are a lot of cat doodles because I love cats and there are my email and github username so anyone can reach me.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The cost with applied $10 coupon is $36.11.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I followed the tutorial from the website but also was not sure in few things so I had to ask people in #electronics in Slack and they helped me a lot.
