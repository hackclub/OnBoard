I created a board that makes it easy to create cool sounds from playing chords and strumming. It is powered by an esp32 which supports many libraries like mozzi and other signal processors to make a synth like device. I was inspired by the omnichord.

## Cost
The cost it takes to make the board is $8.80 which is reasonable, but the assembly costs $71.32 which is a lot. JLCPCB only allows the assembly of 5 or 2 boards, which i only really want 1 assembled. Since this costs a lot, i have to buy the esp32 out of pocket which is fine.

## Design Process
I started off with a sketch on paper of what i was going to make. It was going to have this and that, and more. Some features had to be thrown out due to the limited amount of gpio. 

I then went to create a schematic in KiCad with all the components i needed and what they require to work. 

After this was to layout all of the components on a PCB. Routing all the wires was kind of difficult as it was my first time and there was so many. After this, I added my own flare with my custom silkscreen sketches.
