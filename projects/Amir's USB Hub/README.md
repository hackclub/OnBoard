# USB A - 4 USB's Hub

This is a USB Hub that plugs into a computer or a smartphone. With this USB hub, you can connect up to 4 devices at a time. For example Keyboard, mouse, USB drive, or a gaming controller. 
This device can be useful if your computer does not have enough USB ports to connect your devices to.

The actual price on the JLCPCB website would be $47.79, but an actual price for all the components would be about 5 to 8 dollars. That is, if I order all the parts, I can solder them to the board myself.

The designing process was challenging, but not hard. The original tutorial asked for 2 USB ports, but I included 4. I actually found myself enjoying the process, because I already have experience in soldering PCB boards. Overall, I enjoyed the challenge,
and now I know how to make and design! Thank You for providing me this opportunity.
