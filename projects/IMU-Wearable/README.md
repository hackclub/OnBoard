# IMU Wearable

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

It's basically a breakout board for ICM20948 IMU. But it's smaller than ones on the market, which makes it more suitable for attaching it onto my fingers. I'll wire the IMUs to a microcontroller I'll attach to the wrist, and they will be used to help track finger positions. 

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

$93.16 for 10 boards! I know that it's recommended to go for the minimum amount of boards to be able to iterate, but buying in bulk instead of dividing it into two orders is more economical. (plus I have 10 fingers, not 5!)
I hope that's okay. Plus, I'm pretty confident it's going to work.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->

I mostly just referenced the examples that's recommended in the datasheet for each component, and also referenced some existing board's schematics. It's my first PCB, but I got some help from a friend who is very experienced with designing them, so it made the experience much better than if I was to do it alone. It's also why I'm more confident about the design!
