# E-Fidget Lite

## Summary

The E-Fidget Lite is a small fidget toy on a PCB. It uses a relay to create the
feeling of a haptic "click". An ATtiny13A is responible for controlling the relay's
interval, and a 6mm pushbutton connects the microcontroller to a coin battery when
pushed. This device can be used to aid in focus & anxiety prevention, while being discreet
and far less distracting than a fidget spinner.

## Plan

I will order 5 boards from JLCPCB, who quotes $33.60 for the boards, economic
assembly, and parts. Some parts, which I expect to be outside of the grant,
will also come from Digi-Key (such as the battery holders which are not
PnP-able, and the SOIC programming clip, and some jumper wires for
programming.) These extra parts will cost $23.05. The total cost is $67.55,
not including tax and shipping.

## Design

I used KiCad for everything. (OSS and OSHW for the win!)
