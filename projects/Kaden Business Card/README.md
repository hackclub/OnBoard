# KADEN'S PCB BUSINESS CARD
<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My first ever pcb I have made, following the tutorial it simply will have an LED on it, and I'll be able to give it out like a business card.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$39.49 With shipping

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The hardest part of it all was trying to understand the pcb design part, I've never seen circuits this close up and worked with their logic.
