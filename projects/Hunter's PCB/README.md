# Hunter's PCB (NFC card)

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I followed the Hack Club hacker card to make an nfc card with a blinking LED. It will capture energy through the NFC antenna 
to blink the LED, and I plan to get the NFC chip to link to a custom website of mine!
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It will cost $3.79 before tax, and $4.12 after tax (I think but it might be a little more or less).
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I wanted to make my card look interesting, so I spent a lot of time looking for good-looking repeating patterns to put on the
back. I ended up finding a free stock pattern but then spent a while trying to align it perfectly with my backside copper wire
so that the pattern and wire didn't touch. I hope it comes out good!
