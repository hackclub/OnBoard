# PROJECT NAME
## Summary
##### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
My project is a "Happy Holidays" tag equipped with an EMG sensor that responds to muscle contractions. The tag features RGB lights arranged in a circular pattern, which illuminate dynamically in response to muscle activity. It is powered by a XIAO ESP32C3, making it compact, efficient, and perfect .
##### How much is it going to cost?
