# MMKF Hacker Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
It ia a buisness card with an NFC tag built in. It has different ways to contact me and a few cool logos.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It will cost $48.76
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I should have started by using KiCad instead of EasyEDA because of the limitations that EasyEDA has.
