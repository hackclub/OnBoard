NFC card

my project is buisness nfc card which uses the energy from a nfc compaitable device to light up a led and redirect you to my portfolio website it also has artwork of things i love and mean a lot to me.

$51.69(inc shipping,manufacturing)

not much just following the video and docs from the hack club website .  
personal feedback would be making the video or docs more detailed and explaining the working and a why of an action and stating the obvious because i didnt understand anything in the beginning and felt extremmly lost.
