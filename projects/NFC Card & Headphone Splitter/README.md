# NFC Card & Headphone Splitter

This is based off of the example design but incorperates the added function of being able to share a pair of headphones without sharing earwax. It incoperates 2 3.5mm headphone jacks, (most of you here are makers so I know you all still use aux ports) If this person is a stranger, they can tap your adapter for your contact info. And a signature milk carton to add some uniqueness.

$23.98 for 5 fully assembled boards (JLCPCB) ($4.80 per card)

The biggest issue was finding a source to provide the headphone jacks.
