# FullAdder

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am making a full adder as it was one of the first circuits I ever made. It will have 3 switches and count between 00,01,10,11.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$69.47
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
