# Mobile Power Station 8S li-ion BMS

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is a set of boards for an 8-cell module of Mobile Power Station - a BMS (Battery Management System) board and two connector boards.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Cost:
- $107,89 for all the boards (10 of each board) - including about $50 for components and $28 in Extended component fees
- $19.57 cheapest shipping
- $29.32 customs, duties & taxes

for a grand total of $156.78 minus a few $ from JLCPCB coupons, which means I'll need to do donate the remaining $56,78 to OnBoard.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Well I'll say one thing: it was a **big** project and a lot of work and I'm still not sure if everything is going to work properly lol
