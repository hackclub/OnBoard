# Taylor's NFC Christmas Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I made a NFC card for a christmas gift for my family and I placed an image of a Christmas tree on the card. The LED light that is on the card will be in the place of the tree's star and when the NCF chip is activated the light will shine. I've also included a QR code to "The Carol of The Bells" song on youtube as well as more christmas themed decorations.  

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
This board is going to cost $20.49.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The design process was a very new experience for me because this project was my first time ever designing and creating a functioning PCB board. Some challenges I faced were connecting the components and making sure the routing traces were connected properly. The different layers of a PCB board and what componets were a part of each layer was something that I found very interesting to learn. The EasyEDA software made the process go more smoothly than I expected because it was easy to use and understand.
