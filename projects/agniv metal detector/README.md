# YOUR PROJECT NAME

Making a board for a metal detector! Did the breadboard version of it first, now first time making a PCB. I think it will work but we will see --> the headers on this are so we can connect up the homemade inductor, a battery, and a speaker.

It will cost about 4 bucks for the PCBs and another 14 for faster shipping + some pre assembly (since I've never done it before)

Basically just spent a ton of time learning how to use easyeda and struggling to realize that the 3D view did not auto update... whoops.
