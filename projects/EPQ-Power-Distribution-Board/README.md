# Power Distribution Board

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This board aims to provide variable voltage output (upto 20V) from a USB C Power Delivery input, aiming to help people power their electronics projects e.g. LEDs, Raspberry Pis etc from a single port.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$40 including PCBA and shipping.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Designed for my school course work EPQ, powering the rest  of my electronics. Struggled with IC initially as one I wanted was discontinued so had to use this older one. Used reddit alongside friends to double check my PCB to make sure its not a bomb (mostly).
