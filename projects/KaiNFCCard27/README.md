Kai NFC Card

I made a NFC business card with text and a qr code as well as a logo. It also has nfc opening a website functionality.

In total about $100 including shipping.

I mostly just followed the tutorial in EasyEDA and customized it to myself, but it was a bit confusing sometimes. Especially the JLCPCB process.
