# 4-USB HUB

It is a basic PCB board using 4 usb-A hubs, capacitors to control power surge. It has 2 layers

According to PCB Power which is an authorised vendor as mentioned in the vendors.md file, it is going to cost $62.84 for the PCB and $11.31 as tax (18% tax) . In total it is $74.15 . As shipping is free.

It was actually really simple. From designing the schematics to using auto route for the PCB so that the rat wires do not overlap. Frankly, the hardest part was exporting the project as it was not mentioned in the hackclub , but some googling and asking on the electronics channel in slack helped.
