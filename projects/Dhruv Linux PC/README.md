# Dhruv Linux Board

This board contains 2 raspberry pi 2040s which will be programmed later to run my compiled embedded linux OS.

5 of these assembled with air registered mailing is 93$.

I had to research alot on the 2040 chip because the datasheets everywhere had different schematics which made it confusing for me.
