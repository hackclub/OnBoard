# nfc_card
## Summary
##### It is a nfc card which can be scaned. When you scan it you can see some of my personal information, email, phone, etc. Also It has qr's and links.

## Plan
##### This card will cost 22.03 euro without the customs to be calculated.

## Design
##### It was very easy. I helped by watching the jam for nfc card making.
