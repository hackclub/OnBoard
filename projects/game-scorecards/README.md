# Game Scorecards

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is the Trail project for my group, @DedFishy, @NoahF15, and @dev-gm. We are making a device that reads and writes game scores to RFID cards. This will allow us to keep track of people's skill on the trail and give the best player bragging rights.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The PCB should cost $7.90
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
