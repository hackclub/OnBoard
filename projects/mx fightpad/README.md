# Tinypad

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is a leverless fightpad pcb i designed in EasyEDA. it takes heavy inspiration from the Flatbox rev5 made by jfedor and uses a Waveshare Rp2040 zero and outemu MX switches. i will also design and 3d print a case for this. It uses no assembly from JLCPCB and is meant to be soldered by hand using avalabile components

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It costs 16.10 with no assembly As it does not need assembly and is meant to be hand soldered.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I designed this because i have wanted to build a flatbox rev 5 for a long time but it just is too expensive with all the different parts it needs like the Kalih low profile switches and the heat set inserts. this uses none of that, my project will use a 3d printed case, hot glue, a handful of keyboard switches and a Pi pico. i also made this the pin layout of the GP-2040 CE firmware.
