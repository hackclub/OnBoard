HLPDC


Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? 
I have made a PCB that will act as a buissness card for me, this card has the ability to save URL's using NFC. 
I will also be able to use it along side my flipper zero, which i can use to program it to unlock doors, send notifications when tapped, and many other ideas.


<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
To make the boards it will cost $19.69, thats including tax. But with shipping factored in it would cost a total of $37.49 


<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I make this pcb mostly to just use JLCPCB as well as EasyEDA, I think getting a overall understanding of the programs with take time and i think that will mostly likly be my biggest challenge.
