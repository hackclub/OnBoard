# WS2812B IR NeoPixel Controller

It is a programmable printed circuit board which through Infrared can help me control addressable RGB strips tucked under my desk.

It costs exactly 60.54USD for the minimum order quantity of 5 in which all 5 boards also come pre assembled from the JLCPCB itself. it also the shipping.

I used EasyEDA for the first time to build my very first PCB for which I had no idea about. I took this opportunity to learn from online on building PCBs from youtube, etc. I have also already tried this circuit on a breadboard and it works so I am also quite comfortable into giving this a shot and hoping it would work.
