# Vikki's PCB Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My PCB card uses an NFC chip to connects to other NFC readers. It allows for wireless communications between two electronic systems
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
My PCB build is set at a price of $20.15
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The real challenge was connecting the wires but other than that everything was really easy.
