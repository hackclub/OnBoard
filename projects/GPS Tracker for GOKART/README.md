# GPS Tracker for GOKART

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am building a GPS tracker for my go kart, Im using a GPS module coupled with a raspberry pi connnected to a UPS and a small I2C screen. The device will log the gps data around the track and display Speed, laptime, GPS statistics and some more things if I can code it properly.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$27.90 for the first iterations of boards

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
This is a project for school where I'm allowed to solve a problem which I deem to be an issue to my life, as a avid racer and a now a recent Karter I've always wanted to improve on the track so I thought why not use my skills and build a cool little device to help me out. So over the past few months I've been working out all the circuitry and software side of things and have built a successful prototype and now Im trying to build the real thing. Ive been here since the winter hardware thingo and recently saw this and thought it would be a great oportunity to gain a valuable skill. So after many hours I have successsfully built a custom PCB for this GPS tracker.
