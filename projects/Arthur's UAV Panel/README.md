# Arthur's UAV Panel

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
## Description
I am making a panel PCB for my school UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) plane. It will regulate the battery voltage up to the necessary power for our microcontroller, serve as the point of mounting for that microcontroller, and provide rudimentary overvoltage and overcurrent protection.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
## Price
(excluding shipping) This should cost around $60. This is because a single panel would cost around $30, since to accomodate the power draw of our microcontroller, we need to use 2oz copper for the traces. Moreover, I want to add a buffer in case I made some mistakes with this PCB.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
P.S. Crowbar circuits should be more well known imo.
