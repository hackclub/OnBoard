# Hive

This board will be ejected out of my rocket at its apogee, at which point it will slowly fall down and collect GPS, Pressure, Humidity, and Temperature data and stream it to a ground station I have already built through a Listen Before Talk protocol.

My goal is to deploy 5-10 of these at once and seed an area with these sensors, similar to NASA's CICADA project but without the active control. It is powered by a 1s LiPo battery and has a buzzer to help me find it.

I'm not quite sure it will work because this board has quite a lot of high-frequency analog signals - an active GPS antenna and a radio antenna. I've never worked with these before so I hope I designed it correctly. I made sure to follow a 50ohm impedance where applicable.

I made sure to use as many JLCPCB basic parts as I could to minimize cost. With a $9 coupon, it is $98.95.
