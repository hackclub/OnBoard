# Turtle_USB_HUB_V2

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
For my second USB hub, I wanted to improve some of the flaws of my first board.
I kept the turtle shape but added in smaller compactors and an LED to show when the board is powered. 
In summary, I am making a 4 port hub, an improved version of my previous attempt that uses new, more readily available parts.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
In total my boards will cost $43.60
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I found it hard to find which LED to use as my power signal. After watching many videos on LEDS and Ohm's law, I feel more confident in adding LEDs to my design. 
And now I learned a bunch about how LEDs work!
