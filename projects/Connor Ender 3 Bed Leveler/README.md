# Ender 3 Bed Leveler

## Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
#### This board is designed to be a suitable replacement for the BL/CR touch in 3D printer auto bed leveling. It has a limit switch on the bottom of it that will detect when it hits the bed, and some LEDs that will detect when the board has power, and when it touches the bed. Woo!! Fun lights!!
## How much is it going to cost?
#### The boards will cost almost $9, and I am buying parts to make multiple if I make a mistake in soldering, or in design. Those parts all cost around $15-20.
## Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped?
#### This was an interesting challenge for me as it is the first board I have designed fully by myself. The rest of them I have had a mentor on my FRC team help me with it. This board has been a fun challenge from finding the best parts in terms of cost, and usability, and just general design. Some of the hardest things was trying to find what all pins I would need on the output, or what to use to sense the bed.
