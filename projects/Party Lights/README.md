# RadianceRing
The project is a party light PCB, with four arrays each of four LEDs arranged in parallel. Three different colours of LEDs are used in the circuit - red, green and yellow. When the tactile switch is pressed, the circuit is closed and the lights turn on, combining to create a party lights-esque effect. 

The total order is US$58.05 (Merchandise Total: $47.31 & Shipping Charge: $10.74). I have already paid for the PCB however I will use the grant money to reimburse the cost

We got inspiration from a YouTube video however we made tweaks and changed it to suit our needs. Furthermore, Because of limited stock numbers, we kept having to switch components regularly. We faced many errors running the PCB in simulation mode as the transistors did not have a spice model. We also used many user-generated components at first and then had to switch to components that were available by JLCPCB. Finding the right switch and battery holder proved to be a challenging ordeal, as we had to ensure that it was a tactile switch that could turn on the circuit with the press of a button.
Note: We chose PCB-A type standard instead of economic since our circuit would not be manufactured by JLCPCB if economic was chosen (due to the specific push switch that we chose)
