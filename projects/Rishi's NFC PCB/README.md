# RISHI's NFC PCB

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

I am making a NFC Tag that will transmit a URL or anything really after it is programmed. I am decorating my PCB to make it look cool as well and I think it's a overall cool project that can help me learn how to make PCBs more and more. I'm excited for this board to come and I hope it's a step into PCB design.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

JLCPCB says the final cost is $38.29, but I also have a 9 dollar coupon for the assembly JLCPCB has given for free, so the expected total is $29.29.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
