# VKeyboard

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is a custom 75% keyboard made loosely following Ai-03 and MasterZen's tutorials because I wanted to find a 75% keyboard with the spacing I liked and I wanted to try it. I drew a Wooper decal and put it on the PCB.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$53.10 total: $20.60 for a PCB prototype, $7 for the bottom side stencil, and $25.10 for shipping.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
