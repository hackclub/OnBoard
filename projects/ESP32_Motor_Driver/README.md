# ESP32 Motor Driver

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This board will be used in a lunar robot for the NASA HUNCH Program. It contains H-Bridge circuits to drive 2 motors and an ESP32 Devkit as well as a gryoscope and accelerometer that communicates through my. The board can be connected to a lipo battery and uses a power management IC to charge/discharge the battery.


<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The total price is $45.09.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I used Autodesk Fusion to create this PCB design, which was somewhat difficult to work with. In the future I will use a different PCB design software (like KiCad). Reading the datasheets for the parts I chose was also difficult, but also rewarding, since I understand how the PCB and components work.
