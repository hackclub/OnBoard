# nfc badge
## Summary
##### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?

Basically, think of it as an NFC buisness card, but instead of being the size of a credit card, it's the size of a convention badge! 
Meant to be worn around a lanyard, it is a pcb that, when scanned, shows my contacts. I'll be able to go to events with this, and be able to share my info super easily. 

## Plan
##### How much is it going to cost? What's your timeline?

I'm planning on making multiple versions of this, each version costing around 30-40usd, so I'll be able to make around 3 versions - all with different designs and slightly different layouts. 

## Design
##### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional**

I am completely new to PCB design so this is my first time doing all of this :D
I don't know a lot (and by that, I mean I don't know anything) about PCB's, so I've been learning as I go, through watching tutorials and asking a ton of questions on the hack club slack.
