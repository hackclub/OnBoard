# Herlev Motor Controller

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I have designed a speed controller for usage in electric gokarts/greenpower cars (https://www.greenpower.co.uk/) it's designed to be powered with 2 standard 12v car batteries and power a standard 4000 rpm motor. The design includes inbuilt datalogging, current sensing and voltage sensing of both the batteries and the motor in order to determine race performance and to optimise the motor control loop in future revisions.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$80.43

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Finding components which are both rated to the current levels of car batteries and that are easy to solder was quite diffcult, finding through hole components is crucial in order to allow for easy repairs during a race.
