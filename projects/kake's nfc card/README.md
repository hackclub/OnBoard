# NFC Card

## Summary
This PCB, as per the "PCB Hacker Card" tutorial, is like a business card but with one catch: it has NFC! The NFC chip on the card can be programmed to store a variety of things, from my email to a link to a website. This card is definitely not your average business card.

## Cost
This design should cost $40.33.

## Design
While editing the PCB, I realized that the pads on the front of the board went all the way through to the other side, which didn't look good. So I did a bit of digging around the internet and figured out that I could use blind vias to have a trace on multiple layers without having an ugly hole in my PCB. 
Designing a PCB for the first time was daunting, especially when I started deviating from the tutorial, but I was able to make it in the end.
