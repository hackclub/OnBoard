# ControlPad

This board is made to control robots or even be a macro pad beside you. I made this one for controling Agro Ratna(School Aricultural Robot) but going to use the 2nd one personally as a macro pad or to control something.
Well first it was fustrating, then I watched a video(the one linked above) and it cooled me down. After having to do some wiring and research i finnaly had a error i coulnt solve on line so then i took help in #electronics channel and figured that out. There was the hard part done, then i got the skill of wiring and checking coverting into pcb and DRC checking and loved it.

Cost: This board costs $100.92 (Please OnBoard Grant givers please give me the extra 0.92) with shipping and love.
