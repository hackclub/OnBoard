# PianoUSBhub

I made a pcb board for a USB hub to create more USB ports for my laptop. It's in the shape of a piano so the USB connectors look like the keys. 

It takes 87$ to create an assembled one + I live in Canada so shipping is an extra 40$. I've decided to order the USB type-A connectors seperatly so I can solder it myself. This brings my total to $86.88 with shipping (and 3$ for the USB connectors)

I already wanted to create a USB hub because only one of my USB ports actually works, but I did not know what shape I wanted to make it. 
So, I asked my sister and she said a piano would be cool, and I agreed. 
First, I made the schematic diagram, drew the outline of the piano, and then connected all of my parts.
The hardest and longest part and was figuring out how to connect the parts without them interceting eachother, but with the tutorial I quickly learned how to fix it.
