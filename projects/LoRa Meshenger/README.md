# LoRa Meshenger for The Trail

mesh + messenger = meshenger

This is a device me, evan, cosmin, alex p, and krisk created for the trail event
This device utilizes LoRa technology to send text messages between users even over long distances.
it also has meshing capability, allowing messages to be relayed through multiple devices to reach group members spread far apart

The total cost for 5 boards, with only 2 boards fully assembled, is $60 (shipping not included).
With shipping is $72

During the design process, we faced challenges due to the tight budget constraints. To overcome this, we carefully selected cheaper components while ensuring that the overall cost per board remained within the allowed budget. This required extensive research and comparison of various parts to find the most cost-effective solutions without compromising the functionality and reliability of the LoRa Messenger.
