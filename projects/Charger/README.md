# Charger for my Arduino projects

I made a custom PCB with some help of a tutorial that will act as a powerbank for my Arduino projects as it can charge them via USB and also recharge the batteries via usb-c with some leds to show charging progress which helps a lot and will be used by me a lot.

$81.31

The tutorial was very helpful, although it is very short and I had to add some things on my own and batteries cost is not included in this so i am gonna have to purchase them seperately otherwise it was a fun process to build this.
