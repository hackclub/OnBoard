# MAVterm

The MAVterm is an very simple board that fixes a problem my team had where the terminating resistor 
for the CANbus on our robot broke, and we figured designing a board for it would be the best solution. It 
consists of a connector to plug in both wires of the CAN, and a 120 ohm resistor on the end of it.

##### How much is it going to cost?
Both sets of boards will cost around $10 total.
##### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped?
On the MAVterm I added a mounting hole on the back of it because, though it will not mount onto something,
a 3d-printed case will be designed for it so that it does not get damaged. The same kind of idea was implemented
ont he MAVprox, but at first I  put slots rather than holes so that the team could fine tune the exact placement of
the sensor, but in the end, I chose to put just holes, and put slots on the 3d-printed cover in order to make it nicer.
