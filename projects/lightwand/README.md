<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
A NeoPixel strip of lights can be plugged into it and then with the gyroscope and the microcontroller, the lights change color when you shake it! I'm hoping to make those cool long-exposure light photos but with rainbowwww!

<!-- How much is it going to cost? --> 
More than a $100! So far, I've spent probably $300 or $400 counting the previous JLCPCB prototype orders and the parts I ordered from Digikey after realizing that half of my parts couldn't be assembled by JLCPCB.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
First time making a PCB and at first I had NO idea what to do. Luckily, the Slack people were a lot of help for looking over the design. This was also my first time soldering and I had quite a bit of trouble but meeting up with Kevin in Boston was a ton of help! I learned soooo much!!


PS. This was for the Trail but I was running really really low on time and didn't really have time to submit for Onboard and wait to get the money to order. I bought overnight shipping from some other manufacturer and soldered everything the same day as leaving, in the very very early morning, like 2 am lol. It all pretty expensive... I used my own money at the time because I was planning to submit after for a reimbursement of as much as I can get. Hopefully it'll work out! :)
