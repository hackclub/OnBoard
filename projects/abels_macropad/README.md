# Abel's Macropad

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My board will help me code and do everyday tasks on my pc. I will make a macropad, which will have 12 switches, which can be assigned any function and 3 rotary encoders as well, which will provide an even larger usability.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Around a 100 dollars

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
This was the first pcb I designed in my life, so I had to learn a little bit at the start, but after that it went fluently. I had to redesign my pcb multiple times due to several issues, but I managed to finish it :).
