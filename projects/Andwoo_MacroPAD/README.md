# Macropad

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My board is a pcb for a Macropad that uses 12 total switches that I provide, it also has 2 knobs for video editing and volume control!
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$99.39 but I think there are coupons to make it go down.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
My cousin told me about this project and im fascinated with mechanical keybs, so i made a macropad!
Routing the traces were painful but satisfying.
