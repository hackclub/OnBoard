# Josh's Screen Badge

Purpose:
The Screen Badge device is a wearable device that can display anything in 16 bit color. 
For my purposes, I'm going to be using it as a button at the FRC Greater Kansas City Regional for team 1810.

Cost:
5 boards will approximatly cost $60.15 in parts. This does not include the 3.5" display which I will supply myself (https://www.amazon.com/Fafeicy-Display-Peripheral-Interface-ILI9488/dp/B08CN6M9VC) which adds $18.96 for 1 board.

My total cost should be $93.99 minus the $9.00 SMT coupon.

Design Process:
This is my third PCB I've designed my senior year, and by far the hardest to route because of the tight 100 * 68 mm size constraints.
I also had some trouble figuring out the power supply for the board as I wanted to make it light. 
I ultimately decided on having 2 CR2032 as a power supply and added a center positive barrel jack just in case.
