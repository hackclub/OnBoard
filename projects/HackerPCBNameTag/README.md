<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

  It's a board based on the HackerBoard design but with added features like a rechargeable battery for extended life. It is supposed to function with or without a battery just by flipping the switch, without a battery it functions like a normal hacker card by lighting up some LEDs when scanned via NFC. But with the battery, it's able to light up LEDs for an extended period of time, and it's even able to recharge itself from NFC or another wireless-charging source.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

In total, with shipping, it will cost 100.54$ CAD or 74.30$ USD. This is including a discount of $12.17 CAD.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->

At first, some of the challenges were getting more used to KiCad, I switched from EasyEDA to KiCad because of trouble with EasyEDA's auto-routing tool.
