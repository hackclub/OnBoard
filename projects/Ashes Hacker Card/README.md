# Ashes' Hacker Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I'm making the hacker card. It has a Qr Code. It also has mysterious text.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It will cost $22.01 with a coupon.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I followed the tutorial. It was hard finding the LED I wanted. I wanted a yellow one. I also don't know if I made any design errors when making my PCB. We'll see.
