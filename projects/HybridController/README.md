# YOUR PROJECT NAME
Hybrid go kart controller
<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This pcb is for the hybrid go kart that I am currently working on. In my design, the gas motor and electric motors 
are meant to work independently, but this controller is the bridge between them, with the speed display, battery 
display, mode selection, and other important information.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
My board will cost $63.79
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I was looking for a cool project to work on so I was looking at go karts, and I saw that nobody had built a hybrid go kart so thats what
this pcb is for. It is to combine the controls for the gas and electric motors.This process was a great learning experience since I 
learned how to design pcbs and use KiCAD and there werent many resources for a project like this
