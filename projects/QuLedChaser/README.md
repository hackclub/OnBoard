# Circular LED Chaser

### Summary

The board incorporates a 555 timer to generate a clock, and there is a separate clock input for customization with the circuits we build in class. This clock powers a counter which incrementally lights up LEDS 1-10 in order, so the LEDS will turn on one after another. Overall, the board should display lights travelling around in a circle when either connected to vcc or when an external clock is used.

### Design

This was the first time building something like this so the main challenges were working through the requirements to turn a design into a real board, such as wiring in 2 layers/ using all the right parts and footprints
