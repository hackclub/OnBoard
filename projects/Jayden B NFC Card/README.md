Jayden's Hacker NFC Card

My project this weekend was to follow the tutorial on Hack Club's website to create a digital business card. I started making this card to learn more about PCB cards, as I had no knowledge to it before, so that I can
efficiently learn the process to share to my board members and club members. I made this card for my parent's store.

It's going to cost $33.67

My biggest hurdles was the initial process of learning the technical things, which I still don't get completely, but I quickly got the hang of it and understood what connects to what. Another hurdle was just trying
to find a design for the card that worked and figuring out the layout of the components to make it look nice on the card. The tutorial was definitely a lifesaver and the seperate branches of tutorials within the
tutorial, such as the "ordering from JLCPCB" document helped tons.
