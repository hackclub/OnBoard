JPL.mp3

This is my first revision of the JPL.mp3 circuit board. The JPL.mp3 will be an ESP32 based portable MP3 player inspired by classic iPods, and allowing for flexible music organization through the use of custom firmware. This board holds the ESP32 WROOM microcontroller, an I2S DAC, battery management circuitry, along with a connector for a 2" TFT display and unique "click wheel" style rotary encoder sold by Adafruit. 

The four layer PCB costs USD 7 to fabricate and 1.5 to ship. Considered adding the stencil but held off for this one as it made shipping 15x more expensive. 

Although I have desgined a few PCBs before, this has been my most complex project so far. As a fan of open source software, I have used KiCAD for a while now. That being said, I am very used to the precise parametric design features of 3D CAD programs, which made precise positioning of components a bit tedious. I would say that I have learned a lot designing this board!
