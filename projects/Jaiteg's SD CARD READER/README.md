# Jaiteg's SD CARD READER

This is a PCB which has a sd card reader ic and 2 different sd card ports which are going to help me flash images for raspberry pi.

It will cost 45 US Dollars.

This PCB has a Top layer and a bottom layer and to jump connections i have used a via in between many routes. Trying not to short anything in the connection was the real challenge.
