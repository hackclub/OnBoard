# Raver - an audio visualizer with the XIAO RP2040, PCM1808, and PCM5100A

I made an audio visualizer using JavaScript at raver.tobycm.dev, made it into a Chrome extension as well. This will be the sequel to the 2 digital version by having a physical audio visualizer lol. Featuring a line in and line out 3.5mm headphone jack as well as a usb c audio input to receive and output sound signal, pin headers and test pads to debug and extend, and of course awesome art.

This is my fifth pcb ever. I developed this for my pixeldust ysws submission and had so much fun and learned so much as well from the process.
