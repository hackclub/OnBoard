# 3D Printer HeatBed

Alright so im making a 3d printer heatbed. I want a heatbed of a specific size but its not available, so i challenged myself to make one.
Ideally it should be able to get hot enough to print most if not all engineering filaments, which is what I made it want to do

Due to its pretty big size, itll cost 76 USD

Alright, so my first issue was figuring out how this stuf worked. After research, I started working. And maaaaann this took wayy too many redesigns, as I was facing issues
getting proper copper tracks/traces spacing to manage current, yet get proper power and resistance. Am trying something different by having low resistance 
but long traces to hopefully be able to heat up the heatbed faster. My maths works out, so hopefully works :p
