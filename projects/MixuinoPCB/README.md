# MixuinoPCB

My board is the PCB version of my Arduino project, Mixuino, which with wires is very janky and unreliable so I decided to make a PCB.
It is an Audio mixer that uses slide potentiometers and an Arduino NANO to change the volume of individual programs on a windows machine. (Learn more github.com/ThePangel/Mixuino)

The Board is cheap, 5 units coming to around a .75 cents a piece for a total of 3.75€, the potentiometers I chose can be obtained on amazon for about 8€ for 5 pieces, they have 2 channels and work great, the most expensive part is the Arduino NANO which varies in price but you can get for 5€.

I started the design with the end product in mind (which worked great), I had some issues since its the first PCB I've made so im not familiar with the tools but the process was relatively smooth,
I had to make my own foorprint and symbol for the potentiometer, that was the hardest part but came out great.
