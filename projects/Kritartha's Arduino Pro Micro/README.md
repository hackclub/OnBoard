# Kritartha's Arduino Pro Micro

It is a Arduino Pro Micro inspired board that has very less amount of gpio and is used to connect items like relays, neopixels and oleds. The project is goign to be directly integrated in my smart home project where I will be using this board to connect relays to turn things on and off and the ceiling neopixel argb strip.

It costs $81.71 for 5 boards all assembled.

It is a Two layer pcb having a form factor of almost a mini usb hub. I have also added rounded curves at the edges and getting it designed in black so that looks premium while accomplishing the task I want it do. This is my first time designing my PCB so it was a bit confusing and tedious for me but the basic nfc card guide on the hack club website helped me get a few ideas on how to build it.
