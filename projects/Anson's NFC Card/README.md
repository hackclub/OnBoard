I designed the silkscreen using canva. The doodle art is from iStock stock photos (https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1133192531/vector/seamless-pattern.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=vW7M01b6xN3KldHFTMePTE14fLAPhnDKVKCwinZ5R0A=)
The biggest challenge I faced was trying to keep all the components as close as possible while ensuring the PCB traces doesn't short.
