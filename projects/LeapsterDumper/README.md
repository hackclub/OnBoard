# Leapster Dumper

This board is an Arduino Mega shield for dumping the ROMs of cartridges for the early 2000s educational system, the LeapFrog Leapster. Educational systems like this are often neglected when it comes to video game preservation, and the only cart dumper that exists is not open source and only sold by an unreliable source, so I decided to make my own. This will enable people to preserve Leapster games more easily and use the ROMs to learn more about the system so that we may one day create an emulator for it.
