# Spiderbot/Navibot (dk which one is cooler)

My board is a design that will attach to my chassis and drive motors, use IR sensors, ultrasonic sensors and be able to control a servo and LCD.

My board will cost 100$ on the dot, although I request for a grant of 105$ just in case of international transaction fees <3

I first had to choose the parts, where i decided to go with the raspberry pi Pico. The motor driver was a hard choice but i decided on the MX1508 driver (after looking at L9110S and L293D/N). The IR sensors are TCRT5000 modules. I then made a PCB layout and used Auto Router to route for me. I checked the nets one last time before submitting. I also submitted the BOM to my manufacturer in advanced so that the components could be sourced easily.
