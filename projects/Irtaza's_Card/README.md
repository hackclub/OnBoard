# Hacker Card

I followed the tutorial to make a hacker card which has my name, email, github, and portfolio website and an NFC chip that can be used to store a website link as well!

<!-- Cost -->
$9.07

The hardest part was getting the images onto the PCB. It was really hard to find the perfect black and white balance, but i got the hang of it in the end!
