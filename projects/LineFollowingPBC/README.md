# Line FollowingPCB (for robot)
## This is my attempt at making a line following robot, I and entering the Manitoba robot games, and I have gotten all the materials needed for this project,
It should be able to follow a black line on a white surface. I am following a tutorial by Bot Reboot (https://www.hackster.io/anova9347/line-follower-robot-with-pid-controller-cdedbd#overview)
the robot is very much identical to this tutorial excpet for a few modifications. such as no 3D printing/wires connecting the IR sensors, as well as getting rid of the blue tooth module.

##Plan
so far this project has costed around 80 dollars excluding the PCB as I have been sourcing other hardware parts from robot shop. I am in the endgame of my timeline where I'll be cleaning everything up and
uploading my code once the pcb arrives.

## Design
Like i've mentioned before this is not an original design, but one with slight modifications. in my early stages of designing I had issues with figuring out what
the tutorial is doing as they did not go into detail with the hardware aspects, I watched the tutorial as well as googling parts that is similar to the one in the tutorial
(because I couldn't find exact the same ones) after day 10 of desiging i figured out what should be done, and moved onto the PCB desgining. I had a lot of fun during the process!
