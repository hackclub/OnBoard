#Fatuma_GitHub_Card

My card is a simple PCB that has my name, cute flower design and github handle.

Order Total: CAD $49.62

I never made a PCB before. Making the schematics was very challenging because it was my first time doing that. I just never did electronics before and I relied heavily on tutorials and just ignored the errors. Maybe I will make more :)
