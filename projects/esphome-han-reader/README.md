# ESPHome HAN Reader

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
## Usage
In Sweden and Norway afaik we have a port on our electrical meters called the [HAN-port](https://github.com/u9n/hanporten) (Home Area Network), with this port you can get details about your power usage in almost realtime and with extreme detail compared to alternatives. I use Home Assistant in my home and we recently got our electrical meter replaced with one that has a HAN-port so I saw that as an perfect opportunity to learn some stuff and have fun.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
## Costs
Due to the amount of components and the RJ12 port aswell as ESP8266 and FTDI chip, the total cost of ordering from JLCPCB with the cheapest shipping alternative would come out to $84.36 USD. 

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
## Design Process
I've never really designed a PCB close to something like this so this was an incredible challenge. First time using KiCad aswell so alot of youtube and googling. Needing to learn everything, routes, arcs, grids, and exporting to JLCPCB. My biggest problem was without a doubt, KiCad or KiCad Wakatime crashing like every 15 minutes. The problems with the wakatime addon that now have been fixed required me to do this project almost without any time tracking sadly, but that wasnt gonna stop me, KiCad was going to by crashing ALOT. But obviously I managed to finish my project with a few braincells left. As I'm typing this it's 6AM day 2 and I just got done, I just went on school break and I have already managed to fu*k my sleep schedule ðŸ™‚
