All the gerber files are included in the tutorial but it was difficult to learn how to import the eagle files into easyEDA as the interface isn't exactly beginier friendly.
Then when exporting the gerber files easyEDA kept saying that not every input is correctly connected and I spent ages trying to figure out what went wrong.
Eventually it seems that it's just a bug by easyEDA and all have been connected correctly.
