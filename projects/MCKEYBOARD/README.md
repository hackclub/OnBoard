# Custom 65% Keyboard

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

I've designed and built a custom 65% keyboard PCB, entirely by myself. The board is powered by an Atmega32U4 microcontroller, which is popular in the DIY keyboard community for its USB functionality and programmable capabilities. This project allowed me to tailor every aspect of the keyboard to my preferences, from the layout to the firmware.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

$121.16
