# Elin's PCB Business Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
It's a business card designed as a PCB with an NFC that transmits an URL to your phone on tap while lighting up an LED.
It has a futuristic design

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$20 (+$10 shipping)

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I followed a tutorial on one of the jams. I had fun designing the art. Inspired by Cyperpunk
