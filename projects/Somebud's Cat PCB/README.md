# Somebud's Cat PCB

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This board is designed after a cat's head, made as a little distraction device. It vibrates when the user touches the corresponding circular pads.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$49.88 with shipping

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The main cat came from the brainstorming process during picking parts from the cap, after seeing the vibrating motor, this came to mind. The cat drawing was basic but the drawing on the back was made by my friend. For the actual parts, the battery being an eye and the touch pads being in the area of the whiskers. The motor became what could be recognised as a nose, to make up for its odd shape.
