# PROJECT NAME
## Summary
##### My board is an NFC business card. It is similar to the one Maggie did on the livestream. 

## Plan
##### Manufaturing cost: $3, Shipping: $20 (could be reduced to cheaper shipping plan).

## Design
##### The design is similar to Maggie's design, but I added a few of my own touches here and there. I added the LED light in the letter "O" in my name, and I also used custom fonts such as John Muir Sans and Source Code Pro. As for issues, I had a bit of trouble importing SVGs, so instead I used PNGs. The recording of Maggie's livestream itself was generally quite helpful and informative.
