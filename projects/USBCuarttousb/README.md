# USB TO SERIAL CONVERTER

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is a USB to UART (Serial) converter. I did it bc a friend of mine had a similar one, but his used usb mini b and had almost no 3.3V current.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Around $70
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
