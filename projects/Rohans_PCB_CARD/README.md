# PROJECT NAME
## Summary
##### My objective is to PCB Business Card that has NFC and can harvest Energy from and Light up whenevre the NFC is activated.

## Plan
| Type of Cost  | Cost   |
| ------------- | ------ |
| Maufacturing  | $18.62 |
| Shipping      | $25.74 |
| Total         | $44.36 |

It will take 4-5 days to setup the project once I receive the PCB.

## Design
#### Having never designed a PCB before, I found it to be the most challenging aspect of the project. However, I thoroughly enjoyed learning the process from YouTube. Once I had a solid understanding of the basics, I used EasyEDA to design and create this PCB.
