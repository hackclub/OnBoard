# DIY AVR CANDLE

This is a small cute arduino based led fader circuit which is programmed to look like a candle.

it costs around 51$ including shipping.

it has a 2 layer design and every component is placed like it is smushed together so it was a bit difficult to trace routes. After that I chose to fill the empty spaces by layers aswell.
