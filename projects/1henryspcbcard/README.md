# YOUR PROJECT NAME
Henry's Personal Business PCB Card!
<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I made a personal card that has a QR code that redirects to my Github profile pic and also has a light! This would be a prized possession in 
my wallet for sure.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Approximately around CAD $14.50 (not final price)
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I Added a lot of images that correlate to who I am, for instance, I added Tony Tony Chopper, A Reindeer from my favorite anime, One Piece,
the card can be compared to a Biography. This is also my first time making a PCB without any prior experience
