# Samarth's Bussines Card
## Summary
#####  I made an NFC-based business card initial design after watching Maggie's tutorial but changed the schematics a bit to include extra LEDs.

## Plan
##### It should cost in total $31.76 , with delivery charges included! It will take 2â€“3 days to deliver, according to JLCPCB.-

## Design
##### I watched Medggi's tutorial for initial design, and then I changed the schematics to include extra LEDs.
