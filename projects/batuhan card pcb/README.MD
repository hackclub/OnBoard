# business card pcb
## Summary
##### this is the nfc pcb from the tutorial, i have put my name and an ascii format of my face. i think it looks silly and it doesn't really serve a big purpose besides being a business card
this is my first time with pcb design.

## Plan
this is going to cost 24.50 including shipping, 2 dollars of which are the pcbs and the rest are shipping.
