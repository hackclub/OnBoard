# Macro Stick, Busness Card, and Soldering Practice
## Summary
##### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
The macro stick will be used for personal automation for repetitive tasks. Additionally, it will be used to train members of my school programming club in arduino and micro python.
The business card, will be used as a personal business card.
The third board, a slight alteration of the Totem keybard design (by GEISTGEISTGEIST) will be used as soldering practice.

## Plan
##### How much is it going to cost?
The boards and assembly will cost $93.55. I will purchase the remaining parts on my own.
## Design
There were a lot of challenges with wiring up the rp2040 for the macro stick, but eventually I figured everything out.
## Aditional Notes
The two jsons are directly from easyeda.
The the .pcb file is a kicad export. The BOM and CPL files are for the totem board in case you cannot deal with the .pcb file
