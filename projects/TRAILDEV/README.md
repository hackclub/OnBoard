# TRAILDEV (Textual Raspi Access Interface for Lightweight Development)
This is a [The Trail](https://trail.hackclub.com) project designed to fix other projects when they break. Inevitably, someone's code will have a bug, and the idea of the TRAILDEV is to be able
to fix it in the field. At its core, it's a Raspberry Pi *Zero*, a screen, a keyboard, and some batteries. Development is ongoing in #the-traildev-computer. 
The cost of this order is currently about $80, with an annoying amount of that being shipping and extended component fees. I also ordered the screen off Amazon for about $10 and I have the Pi on hand.
