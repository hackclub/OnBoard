# cyrilli's hacky-holidays submission

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is a board using an AT89LP51 microcontroller to control 10 red-green dual colour LEDs and a piezoelectric buzzer. Timers 0 and 1 will be used to output a PWM signal for two of the LEDS, and Timer 2 will be used to play simple pitches on the buzzer. It is themed around the CR400BF-5033 EMU, a well-known meme by Chinese railfans because it had numerous issues during operation, including an overheating axle leading to a stall.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
US$ 39.47 including PCBA and shipping

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
