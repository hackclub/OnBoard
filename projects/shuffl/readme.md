# Shuffl+

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
Shuffl+ is an inspired version of the original apple ipod classic. I really liked the idea of a music player and the integration of blueetoth to connect with bluetooth speakers/headphones
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
the pcb itself costs $96

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I read a few datasheets online about the screen, the raspberry pi zero2w and for other parts, for the 3.7v to 5v voltage step up i watched a few greatscott videos to understand how it works
