# RÃˆGLE PCB (*PCB RULER*, in French)

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I decided to create a custom ruler PCB for my school robotics team, bearing our logo and name as well as that of our main sponsors. It is at the crossroads of electronic design (due to the very nature of PCBs) and of art.
I plan to personally hand one to each and every single one of our team members.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$59.59 USD (incl. shipping)

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
See [my design process in more detail](docs/workflow.md). My main challenge was vectorising bitmap graphics, and the best solution was hard work and patience.
