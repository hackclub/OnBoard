# YOUR PROJECT NAME

This project is a 555-timer based LED chaser, which uses a 555-timer chip to build a sequential counter. This board will cost around $25 in total with the LEDs, chips, and other inserted components. Some challenges were navigating how to use EasyEDA, but in general, it wasn't too bad.
