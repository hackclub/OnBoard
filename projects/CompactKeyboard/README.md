Compact Keyboard

##### I created a compact keyboard that runs off a Raspberry Pi Pico! It will allow me to program the keyboard to perform different actions depending on the keys! I can 3D print custom keys with different functions!
I wanted to test my skills by making a compact keyboard run off a Raspberry Pi Pico!


The cost after shipping is $88.49. Unfortunately, I don't have key switches or a Pico, so those are added to the cost of my keyboard.
