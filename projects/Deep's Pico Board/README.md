# Deep's Pico Board

I have made a Raspberry Pi pico replica using the RP2040 chip and also has a few extra things.

The minimum order quantity on JLCPCB is 5 which only costs about 68$ which is very cheap in my opinion.

The Schematics were easy to design but the pcb was a pain to be made because auto route failed alot of times so I had to manually add traces.
