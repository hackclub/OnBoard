# Wyliboard
## Summary
a split ergonomic 70 key board with a 3d printed case and a custom pcb.

A bit more information may be at https://github.com/wylited/split70kb depending on when you read this.

## Plan
The pcb itself is quite expensive due to its sheer size.
I have a 3d printer and I plan to print the case myself.
also I am using gateron low profile reds, which are quite cheap but also good. My Alternatives are gateron milky yellows if i decide to make another.

I may upload a more detailed cost list if anyone actually wants its.

## Design
This has been in design for a long time (technically almost a year now).
I had to take alot of breaks due to frustration and burn out. The designing process is a bit slow.

I went quite a while thinking I could make this without a pcb, turns out thats even harder than learning how to make a pcb. So I learned. there was some really good guides.

I used kicad and here are some links that i could not have accomplish this without. (sorry for the terrible link formatting, I'm an emacs org mode user not Markdown)
