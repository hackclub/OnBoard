# SopSax

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
It is a digital soprano sax pcb. It requires external soldering and 3D printed keys to work, but this is the mechanical aspect. It will be able to work with DAWs, and Musescore. Another feature that I added to this was a UI Menu that controls some of the features such as various aspects of tone production and intonation.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
About $30, but shipping drives the price up like crazy
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I followed Whackalenso's tutorial for creating a soprano saxophone and gave him attribution, all with his consent. One challenge was making this something that I could use to practice as an alternative to my alto saxophone. I made a UI and used "SoundFonts", which were scripts that controlled various aspects of tone, and I was able to parse it, allowing me to have a soprano sax sound that is decent (which obviously you cannot do on alto saxophone). This is a project I am very invested in because my parents do not want me to practice at home because it creates too much noise. This instrument allows me to practice at my own will and keep my parents happy.
