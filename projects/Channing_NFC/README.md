Channing NFC

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My PCB board is a NFC business card that includes my contact information, and will bring up my LinkedIn page when tapped with a phone. 
I followed the Hacker Card tutorial project for Hack Club, and I spent roughly two hours working on it and experimenting with the design.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It'll cost $38.37 USD ($20.81 subtotal, $13.81 shipping, $3.75 customs).

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
