# NFS TRANSMITTER CARD FOR FTC TEAM 18221 FOR SHIRT FORMS

I made a custom PCB with a help of a tutorial that will use a NFS chip that will record and send out a link that redirects users to FTC Team 18221 shirt form for the Chicago Robotics Invitational.

$40.34

The tutorial was very helpful, although the part about false positives in the PCB was a little confusing.
