# Joseph Business Card

I made a PCB following the tutorial with the electronics and customized it to have images that were relevant to me. For my use if anyone needs my contact info I can share this card to them.

The total is $37.54

I followed the tutorial but I changed the way I placed the NFC antenna, it was also hard putting my images into the designer since when I wanted to scale it it kept only changing one side. To fix this I had to change one number to my wanted number in the import and that made them both equal.
