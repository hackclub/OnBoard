# Dragon_board

<!-- I'm making a PCB board with LEDs that looks like a dragon breathing fire. The shape of the board outline is a dragon, as well as fire comming out of it's mouth. -->

<!-- It will cost approximately $83.52. -->

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
