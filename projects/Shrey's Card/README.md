# Business Card
## Summary
##### This is my version of the nfc business card that was made in the workshop.

## Plan
##### It costs about $49, with the PCB itself costing $30 and shipping costing $19.

## Design
##### I mainly used the workshop to help make my design. At first it was very difficult and there was definitely a learning curve as I had never made a PCB before.
