# 9 Button Macros Keyboard

This Macros Keyboard is a useful device for anyone using a computer. Each of the 9 buttons can be assigned for a task or a command on the computer, for example, open a browser tab, or open an app.

The actual price on the JLCPCB website would be $81.95

This device is meaningful to me because with this I would be times productive! Thank you for providing me with this opportunity.
