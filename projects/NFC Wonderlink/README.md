# NFC Wonderlink
## Summary
My board will be very helpful to build my confidence (as an introvert) and meet more people, so my card has a LED and a QR scan code with NFC inbuilt, 
anyone I want to outreach to in meetings where I go, the user can scan the qr code, while they would be scanning the led light will lit up 


## Plan
| Cost Reason  | Cost |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 5 x Boards  | $2  |
| 5 x Gerber for NFC  | $18.54   |
| Shipping Cost  | $36.2 (India)  |
| Total  | $60 |

## Design
well it was based on the maggie's tutorial with my hint of design :)
