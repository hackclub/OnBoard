# YOUR PROJECT NAME

I made a NFC business card, that will allow me to show my socials to someone, just by tapping their reciever. This card also has a silk layer, with my name, account name, and a qr code of my github. It follows the tradional PBC strucutre of a NFC card, and was an enjoyable project!

It costs 41.08 dollars, which is for the standard, basic version of the card. Luckily, due to the amazing HC OnBoard grant, it is free entirely for me(unless CUSTOMS STRIKE) , thanks HC!

I followed, what I think is the most traditional design process for a PCB, which is design on a software, export it onto a PCB manufacturer's website, and then create. It was an extremly fun process, and I thouroughly enjoyed it, hoping to do it again soon! There weren't many challenges that affected me during the process, but one main problem was the wiring, as I have read you are not supposed to let 2 wires overlap. The thing that helped the most was the HC tutorial, so thanks a lot!
