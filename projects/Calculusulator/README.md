# The Calculusulator (the keyboard part)

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is a project for my AP Calculus BC class, to make a calculator that shows each calculation as the full taylor series generation and approximation. Calculators use this to evaluate functions such as sine, but they are hidden behind the scenes. This will be a teaching tool as requested by my teacher to demonstrate concepts to future classes.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The board + pcba is currently estimated at $95.85 by JLC, but this may change before I place the final order based on tariffs and slight design tweaks. Additionally, it will require a Raspberry Pi 3 B+, a display, battery pack, and keyboard switches/keycaps.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
