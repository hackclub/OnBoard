HCJK_CARD # YOUR PROJECT NAME

I am making an cool NFC Card with Seaport Developers Logo. It would redirect to alink of an github page of SPdevs. And someone also can configure where it would redirect.<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

35.23$ With coupons<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

Honestly it's my first time doing the PCB. At first i thought it was going to be hard, but later i understood it really clearly and i loved it. So far i havent really had any challenges.<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
