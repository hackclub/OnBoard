# Christmas Tree PCB

I wanted to make a simple Christmas Tree PCB to give out as gifts for 2024 Christmas. I drew the shape in Inkscsape and imported it. It used two ICs: a 555 timer, and a 4017 decade counter. I haven't used any ICs in a PCB design that hasn't been from a tutorial yet.  I'm actually really proud of this design of mine, though!

It should cost $19.23.

I used EasyEDA to design it. This was my first time designing a circuit with ICs that I needed to look at the datasheet for/weren't part of a tutorial. I got a ton of help from the lovely people on the All About Circuits Forums. Without them, this would not work. I have already breadboarded everything out to make sure it works. After I make sure the PCBs work, I'm going to spend about $200 on ENIG versions + all the parts on Digikey!
