# 7 Input Macropad

This board is inspired by button boxes for sim racing, which are things used to control functions of a car. It could also be used as a regular macropad for shortcut funcitons (e.g. map "ctrl-c" to a button)

It will cost $86.27 (I will buy a Sparkfun pro micro on my own)

Learning how to build a pcb took a bit of time, but once I realized what exactly what I wanted to do, I was able to build it, with a little bit of help from the people in the slack channel! The toughest part was figuring out which board I could use for a keyboard, then figuring out how to wire everything properly to it. I used KiCad to make the schemtic and PCB.
