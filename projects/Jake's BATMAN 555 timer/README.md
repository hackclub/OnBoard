# BATMAN 555 timer

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My board is a 555 timer circuit that displays a series of LEDs that can be used to generate an accurate timing pulse for operating varius circuits. I will be using this timer to drive a coutner for various projects. It is also the shape of the BATMAN SYMBOL and will not be thrown at anyone trust me.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
This cicuit is going to cost $106.07 with shipping,but it is WELLL WORTH.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The design process for the circuit was a lot more fun than i thought, the creative aspects of it were so cool, and my only challenge was not being able add more memes!
