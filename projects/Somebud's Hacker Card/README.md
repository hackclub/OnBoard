# YOUR PROJECT NAME

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am making a hacker card with this project. This board contains a NFC antenna powering a tiny circuit that lights up an LED. On it are my socials and a QR code to a linktree website with more links, which could allow me to add more, and on the back is a image of my Roblox character (the character of the one in the card)
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
In total, it costs 36.15 USD

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
At first I followed the tutorial in laying the basics, then added on some features I thought would stand out. One of those were multiple LEDs, originally the LEDs depicted a blank face, but at one point someone in the community reached out (Thanks Alex Parker!) and reminded me of the available power, among other things. The following redesigns went to a more simple 3 LED face down to a overhaul of 1, after finding it difficult to deal with the power constraints. I figured I needed something artsy in here so I decided to get the profile of my character and plop it at the back. The final addition was a QR code after pondering about it. I figured it would help me make additions to the links whilst keeping this board. In the end I find that the tutorials provided and the surplus of information online really helped me get to this point and create this final product.
