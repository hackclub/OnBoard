# Krishnan Hacker Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I'm making a hacker card pcb for myself. It will contain contact information on a silkscreen and allow me to program tags onto an nfc chip to give people direct links. Finally, it has a QR code to my website.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
My PCB will cost $21.69.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
A major challenge I faced was expanding the design from the tutorial. For example, I wanted a green LED, but it was very difficult to find one that would work (even just theoretically) with the NFC chip. I spent hours talking with others and reading through datasheets in foreign languages, and I'm still not sure whether this will work.
