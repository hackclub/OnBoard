# Shibams-hacker-card

I made my very own hacker card, something like a self introduction card. It has an NFC chip, and an LED, so when a NFC supported device is brought nearby it lights up! Its my first time working with NFC chips, and my fourth hardware project after my macropad, keyboard, and neopixel board, but it was really fun! I spent quite some time to think and create the unique design.

It costs around $2 for the PCB itself, PCBA costs $17.35, and $19.21 for the shipping charges to India via Air registered mail. I have followed the hackclub's Jam tutorial throughout this project and I am really thankful to this community for providing this amazing opportunity!
