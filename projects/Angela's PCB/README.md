# NFC Card for BVHS Hack Club
## Summary
##### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
I designed this NFC card to promote Hack Club during club fairs. It is a great example of what members could create
at our club! The NFC will direct students to our instagram (our website once we finalize it) which serves to encourage them to join. 


## Plan
##### How much is it going to cost? What's your timeline?
The calculated price on JLCPCB is $11.50 - Once this PCB is delievered I will continue to make more complex projects.

## Design
##### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional**
Thank you Maggie for the tutorial and OnBoard team for this oppurtunity!

This was my first time designing a PCB so it was definitely a learning experience. I had trouble with adding designs at first because of the interface but eventually got the hang of it. 
One side of the PCB features the electronics labled which is a simple visual that might interest students. The other side has a fun design that matches our
school colors.
