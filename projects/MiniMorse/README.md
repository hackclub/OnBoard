# MiniMorse

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is a little battery powered board, based on an atmega328P-au that lets you write some text on the display. Then it converts it into morse code and plays it out with the built in buzzer.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
~37$ with shipping for both the board and all the components.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The design process was quite smooth actually but it was very time consuming. Especially when i had to try to find all the footprints and symbols that weren't already imported to kicad. Overall, I am pretty happy with how the design turned out.
