# THE DEBATE DEVICE
Hi there! I made a device to help me and my peers with timing our practce debate time, logging wins and losses, generating motions and tons of other fun nerdy debating things! I feel like I need to explain why I used cherry keyswitches for some of the buttons and it is totally explainable by just saying, they sound nice. The buzzer is another fun addition.
## HOW MUCH WILL IT COST?
It will cost about $25 just for the parts, the manufacturing of the pcb will be $13.40 because the shipping prices are astronimical!
## CHALLENGES AND DESIGN PROCESS
The design process was rather easy honestly, I did hackpad a few weeks ago (which explains the keys :p) so the Kicad wasn't too bad, but the importing of 3D models and footprints was sooooo hard to figure out!
