# PILOT

<!-- I made a PCB to control a dc motor to pull back and forth a DC linear actuator which will pull the dropper release on my bike. It has pin holes for a button and a battery and the motor, as well as programing pins. -->

<!-- 55 dollars in total for the pcb parts 30 of which is from JLC PCB, Plus the motors are 30 bucks and the battery I am using is a prorietary bike battery that is 50 bucks but you could use any 2 cell li ion 300 mah BATT -->
