# FRC CAN Distribution PCB (For WAGO connectors)

It is a PCB for FRC that help us to easily wire CAN. I made another PR but this is the best version of it. (Unfortunatly PLCPCB donÂ´t have stock for WAGO)

Merchandising total is $7.30 and Shipping Estimated is $17.50 giving a total of $24.80 (Dollars).

We had a little bit of complications because at the beginning this was the original design but the WAGO connectors for the assemblie run out of stock, then we make another version for using it while we get the connectors.I can't add the assemblie due to that there are not WAGO on stock. So the idea is get the PCB and us weld the connectors.
