# rc car motor driver

So my project will control an rc car using an arduino and a motor driver which connects to a motor which will have a gear on it which
drives another gear which spins freely on a small axle connected to the chasis with an around 1:(4/5) gear ratio this gear drives a another
gear connected to a much larger axle with wheels on it allowing the chasis to drive with an around (4/5)/3 gear ratio the chasis is connected
to the axle with a cylinder holder thing which allows it to spin freely while also staying connected to the chasis the rest of the chasis is
connected to the front wheels which has 2 separated axles for each front wheel with holes in it and is connected with a + shaped axle which 
this axle is connected to a servo motor which allows the front wheels to turn and spin freely while also being connected to the chasis and
the servo the board will not control the servo but it controls the big motor which drives the back.

$38.87 for the board and driver assembly + ~$25 for the arduino nano

it was my first time doing a schematic it mightve been easier to do with a tutorial but i just did it and i made it happen the only challenge
was figuring out which layer to use most optimally and how to connect all the wires from the motor driver to the arduino pins in one layer
because i wanted to keep every connection at the bottom layer except for the 2 outputs which is on the top allowing me to see where it is
the only downside is jlc pcb doesnt have arduino nanos so id have to get one and solder it myself but i like soldering so its not that big 
of a deal.
