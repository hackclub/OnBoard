# Remote control macropad

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I'm trying to make a macropad which can also send 443mHZ and IR signals, for remote controlling blinds and TVs. It runs on an ESP32-S3, so it also has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. 

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The PCBs are $4.28 for 5 pieces. I want to solder the parts myself, so I also attached a card_aliexpress.png for the parts list, which comes down to around 80 dollars.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I found a great Instructable about designing a PCB around an ESP32-S3: https://www.instructables.com/Build-Custom-ESP32-Boards-From-Scratch-the-Complet/
