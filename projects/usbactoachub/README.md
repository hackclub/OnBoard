# USB A or C input to 3 USB A 1 USB C output Hub!

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This little pcb takes a computer input via a USB-A or USB-C female port and passes it through to 3 USB-A ports and 1 USB-C port. It runs at USB 2.0 speeds, using only the D+/- lines, but should work just fine for typical tasks.


<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
In total, it costs $57.97 on JLCPCB. The boards are $11.90, assembly costs a total of $37.31, and the cheapest shipping is by adding it to another active order of mine, costing only $8.76. I'm also hoping to use a coupon or two at checkout to fit within my current $100 granted by Onboard (of which there is $46.15 left...should've used some coupons the first time too).


<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
This was much more difficult than the last project I did, my 24V to 5V converter. I felt fine using the design tools in Kicad, but struggled to find the correct parts with JLCPCB. I ended up partially redesigning about 4 times to get the parts I need (which better be right), after eventually uploading the files and finding out a part wasn't available for assembly, only on standard PCB, out of stock, etc. It was a struggle, but now it's done.
