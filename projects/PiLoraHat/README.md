# PiLoraHat

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This board easily connects a lora module with a sx1278 chip to a rasberry pi 3. This is much better than the jumper wires I prototyped because its much more portable. I plan to use this to make a wireless game camera (and if that doesn't work a weather station). 

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
48.30 for 2 assembled hats and 3 unassembled 
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I spent 2-3 weeks for the idea stage, then bought 2 rasberry pi's and 2 lora modules from amazon. I spent a long time trying to connect 2 rasberry pi's which had lora moduels attached via jumper wires together with lora. Then I watched many vidoes on easy eda and made the pcb.
