Ayaan's NFC Tag

It's an NFC Tag! Since I got my Flipper Zero from Arcade, I've always wanted an NFC tag to test out and use automations with. Now, I can get one!

The board is $5.20, and the PCBA is $44.67. The shipping is $29.44 but there's a $9 coupon. In total(including shipping), it's $70.31.

This is my second PCB(but it's my first one in easyeda, my other one was in kicad). I challenged myself to not directly follow the tutorial, and only to read it at the start. Suprisingly enough, it worked perfectly and I successfully finished the PCB! Overall, I think I'm a lot more confident when designing PCBs and I might be ready to make a full keyboard for #hackpad now that i've made a macropad and nfc tag design.
