# Evan's Business Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is my PCB business card design. It includes a NXP LPC8N04FHI24E, a lightweight ARM microcontroller, some LEDs, and breakout pads if you want to do some hardware hacking! It's heavily inspired by the [Beast NFC Business Card](https://beastdevices.com/?p=666)
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

It costs about $3 per card (the microcontroller is the bulk of the cost), or about $4.5 per card for a ENIG surface finish.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
This business card was heavily inspired by the [Beast NFC Business Card](https://beastdevices.com/?p=666), the hardest part was routing the microcontroller and properly aligning everything in KiCad.
