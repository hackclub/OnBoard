# Anirudh's Heart LED

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I'm designing a decorative PCB for a flickering heart-shaped LED display. The board uses an NE555 timer to generate a clock signal, which drives a sequence of red LEDs arranged in a heart pattern. The circuit creates a visually appealing flickering effect, making it perfect for wall-mounted decorative lighting.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$50-60
