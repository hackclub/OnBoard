# SuperNFCPCB
The SuperNFCPCB is an nfc card in green. Nothing very extreme, simple enough to do the job, while having a lot of decoration!
It will cost around $18-19. 
While following the tutorial, wiring and tracing made me have a genuine panic attack. im not joking. I had forgot to toggle a setting to "ignore"
Thanks for the grant Hack Club!
