# Hack Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
It's a business card of sorts, that has my Discord and Github usernames on it, and will share a link to a page like my portfolio.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$35 at most 
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I wanted to design it to be minimal, but still represent me (my love of minimalism lol) and adding the usernames helped it to be practical. Adding a copper accent is cool, and made possible by the tutorial I saw.
