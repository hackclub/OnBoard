# Natanon's ContactME (NFC card)

NFC card which contain my contact information (Email, Github, etc.).
With an amazing and cool straightfoward design (Rectangle) and simple shades of color (Black).

The cost of this pcb will be around $29.

I has no experience with designing a pcb before. Luckily, my senior guided me throughout the process.
