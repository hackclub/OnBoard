# Hunters USB MONSTER

I made a USB hub that connects to a coumputer over a micro usb cable!

$55.02

While i was designing it I wanted to use usb type c but whenever i went into JLCPCB it keept saying none where instock so i scrapped that and went back in time to micro usb. I also tried adding led's to the eyes and i could not fiqure out how to get a 90 Ohm resistor it would only let me add a 1k so i removed them.
