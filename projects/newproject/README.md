# PCB Hack Club Project

<!-- I am making a PCB hackcard to promote my friendship with Catie Foley, a student in my grade. She is the bestest and we designed our cards after each other. -->

<!-- $19.48 -->

<!-- One challenge in my design process was trying to find a quality program for outlining the images I wanted to display on my card. The actual component placement was easy and fun. -->
