RP2040 Motor Controller

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

I am making a HAT for a Raspberry Pi that will use an
[RP2040](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pga2040?variant=39359629656147) to
control 4 motors and process inputs from magnetic encoders attached to the
motors. This board is intended to be used in a robot using an omni wheel drive train.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

The PCB is going to cost $3.10 before shipping and ~$50 for the rest of the parts.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
