# FletchVR #

## Description ##
FletchVR is a simple board designed to connect together all of the nessecary components to build a SlimeVR tracker, but in a more organised fashion than soldering many wires. Using a PCB allows for greater scalability and easier assembly

## Associated costs ##
All of the nessecary components to complete this project have already been sourced, with the exception of the PCBs used to connect everything toghether in a tidy fashion.

The costs associated with the PCBs are broken down as follows:

|Expense| Cost |
|--|--|
| Manufacturing | $6.54 |
| Shipping | $15.94 |
| Customs, duties and taxes | $4.50 |
| **Order total** | **$26.98** |

## More info ##

This design was created as a solution to a problem faced when creating SlimeVR trackers, an open-source project designed to provide full body VR tracking through the use IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units - think gyroscopes with accelerometers). As a variety of different components can be used, there was no PCB solution for the specific set of components that I wanted to use, so instead, I made my own. This will, in theory, make assembling the trackers far easier, as there will be no 'rats nest' of cables to deal with.

Chanlenges were faced in choosing the layout for the board, because as the finished product will be worn on the body, it needs to be as compact as possible.

The project was designed using EasyEDA software, and the matching 3D printed enclosure will be produced using Fusion 360.
