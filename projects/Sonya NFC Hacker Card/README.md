# Hacker Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I made a hacker card that will direct my phone to my portfolio website if I tap the card on my phone. The card also contains my name, contact information, and programming languages that I know.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It costs $19.50. The merchandise total is $2, and the shipping charge is $17.50.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
As I was following the tutorial on the Figma presentation, I struggled to find the correct components, but the video helped me.
