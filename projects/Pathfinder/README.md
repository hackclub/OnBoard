Project name: Pathfinder

This PCB is for my regional science fair project: Pathfinder. 
Pathfinder is a spider-inspired electronic walking robot that I made from scratch. 
After winning 2nd place at the district-wide science fair, I decided I wanted to replace the mess of breadboard and wires for a PCB.

According to JLPCB, this will cost ~$99.96 (with a $10 coupon).

Heres an excerpt from the research plan I had to write for this project:
"I will first familiarize myself with the structure and walkcycles of
spiders, in order to gain an important understanding of their fluid movement.
Next, I will design and fine-tune the necessary components in Onshape, an
online CAD development software, before 3d printing them. These components -
coupled with S51 servo motors and an Arduino Mega 2560 - make up practically
the entire body. Finally, with these parts together, code written on the Arduino
IDE is transferred onto the board and gives Pathfinder its movement." 
*Note: this is a simplification of the actual process and doesn't include all of the rigorous testing required at each step.*
