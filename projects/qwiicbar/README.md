<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is a capacitive-touch slider board that connects to other devices with [QWIIC](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic). It's inspired by the Suzuki Omnichord's strummer. v0 is my initial design, I'll figure out how well it works and maybe I'll experiment with adding things like an inner hatched ground plane or exposing the capacitor pads.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It'll cost $11.97 total for the first order. I intend to order multiple revisions, these things seem finicky

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
