# Blackbox Hub

## Description
A USB hub that goes on the bottom of a raspberry pi, specifically sized to hold an SDR and 3 WiFi antennas. Also includes a holder for 2 18650 batteries, and has two pins to power the pi from.

## Plan
cost is ~$53+shipping for 2, thats how many we plan to make for #the-trail

## Design
TheTridentGuy and I combined a variation of a previous power circuit and the tutorial USB hub to create this. The biggest challenge was laying out every part precisely.
