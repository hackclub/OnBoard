# Snowflake

This is my snowflake design for Hacky Holidays. It consists of a button, 48 WS2812B LEDs and a XIAO ESP32C3.

This should cost around $30 including PCB manufacture, shipping and parts. I will be soldering everything myself to save on PCBa costs.

The code can be viewed [here](https://wokwi.com/projects/418889150108342273) which shows a chasing LED effect
