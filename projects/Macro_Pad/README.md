# Macro Pad

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am making a simple macropad keyboard with 12 switches. The microcontroller is programmable so the macros that each key performs can be customized, and it will just help me be more efficient while working on my pc.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
it will cost $46.75 to order the PCBs

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
