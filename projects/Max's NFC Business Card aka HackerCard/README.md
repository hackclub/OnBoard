# NFC Business Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This board is a "universal" business card that can be programmed to do anything you want. It uses NFC to communicate with a phone and can be programmed to do anything you want. It can be used to share contact information, open a website, or even send a text message. </br>
I started making it as I want to get into PCB designing and people might find this a cool "toy" to have. </br>
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
According to JLCPCB a set of 5 assembled boards will cost about â‚¬17.41.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The design process wasn't issue less. I had problems with connecting the antenna to the chip. A few Google searches and HackClub tutorials later I found the answer (multi layer pads).
