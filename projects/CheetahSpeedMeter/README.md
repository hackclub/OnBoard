<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

$101.07

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->

I watched tutorials along with my summer program learning microelectronics to desgin this PBC. Challenges I faced were using EasyEDA and GitHub which were new to me.
