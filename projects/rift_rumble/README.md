# Rift Rumble

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am making a board that uses an ESP32 to control two motors, a servo, and a distance sensor. I am trying to make a sort of multifunctional car for 
STEM education that can be programmed with block code so young kids can learn the basics of robotics. The board will enable control of this car and make sure the experience is enjoyable.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
I want to order around 5 of them to start the program, so the total cost is around 157 dollars.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
