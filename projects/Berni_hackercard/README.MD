#Bernini's Hackercard
I'm designing a custom NFC-enabled Hackercard featuring the NT3H2111W0FHKH chip. The board uses a PCB-embedded antenna to wirelessly communicate with NFC-compatible devices, and it includes an LED that lights up when powered via energy harvesting. Itâ€™s compact, functional, and built to impress with a sleek ENIG surface finish.

ðŸ’¸ Cost per unit: ~$13.40, mostly due to the ENIG finish and the need for standard PCBA manufacturing.

ðŸ”§ Design Process & Challenges
The biggest challenge I faced was switching from EasyEDA to KiCad. I was more familiar with EasyEDAâ€™s interface, and jumping into KiCad felt overwhelming at first â€” especially with the schematic-to-layout workflow, custom antenna design, and learning how to properly manage libraries. However, taking the time to watch tutorials, read documentation, and explore example projects helped me power through. In the end, KiCad gave me the flexibility and control I needed to fully customize my board, and Iâ€™m proud of how far Iâ€™ve come with it.
