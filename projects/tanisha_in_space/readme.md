# YOUR PROJECT HERE
<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This board will be used as a flight computer for a model rocket. 
It will allow us to control servos in the rocket for active control and record flight data and telemetry. 

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
According to jlc, it should cost around $200 for all of the components, but shipping and tarrifs will bring it up to $600

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I led the design for this with my rocketry team. We have been working on this computer and other iterations for nearly a year. 
Being self-taught made everything harder, and we had to rely on strangers for help. Working with my team made this entire project a lot 
more bearable and easier, because I honestly wouldn't have had the courage to get this done without them, given the difficulty.
