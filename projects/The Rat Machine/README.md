# üê≠ The _Rat Machine_ üö®

![3D view of the Rat Machine PCB](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdde6d42-bb82-4760-9fe4-cd10f7df16d7)

## üìú Description <!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

**TL;DR:** A hardware autoclicker that acts as an Human Interface Device (HID) to send clicks

- [x] Left, middle, and right click
- [x] No drivers or software needed (after flashing firmware)
- [x] Keychain hole
- [ ] On-board frequency control

In the world of graphical interfaces, the act of "Mouse Clicking" has become a commonplace activity
among the locals and regulars. However, some individuals have voiced their concerns regarding the
physical demands of finger agitation and of the mere limitations of their muscular dexterity.

At the request of such individual, I have crafted a device which aims to alleviate these burdens by
providing them with the means to emit clicking signals to their personal devices through electrical
automation. And by exploiting the capabilities of electrical components, this device is capable of
emitting clicking signals at a superhuman frequency. For the individuals with lower frequency
demands: worry not, for one must rise above their limitations and not be bound by them.

To fully simulate the functionality of a mouse, this device permits the user to input between left,
middle, and right clicks to their device through this contraption.

## üìù Design process <!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->

These steps provide a general overview of how I ended up with the final result.

1. Come up with the idea
    - I was introduced to Hack Club OnBoard a while ago, but I hesitated starting a project until I had
      an idea that would useful to me and others.
    - Eventually, a friend of mine introduced me to the idea
      of a hardware autoclicker, and I thought it would be a fun project to work on.
    - During this ideation, I also came up with the idea of making the PCB in the shape of a mouse cursor.
2. Get help from someone or somewhere
    - The one who introduced me to Hack Club OnBoard offered to help me throughout the design. Without
      his help, I would have been completely clueless. Thank you so much!
3. The "Human Element"
    - These steps are not necessary, but by personalizing the board, I feel much more connected to it.
    1. The name: mouse -> rat -> rat machine :+1:
    2. Font: I used what one may consider a *non-standard font* for PCBs for the fun of it. It's called
       FOT Yuruka STD UB if you're interested!
    3. Routing: I did this manually, not only to learn how to do it, but also to have an excuse to use
       arc 45¬∞ everywhere.
    4. Shapes! Add shapes on the board using the silk layer. Which shapes? I don't know, just shapes.
4. Tidy up
    - Once everything is laid out, I refactored the schematic file to make it more pleasant to look at.
