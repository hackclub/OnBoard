# PCB Hacker Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My board is a hacker card project, a PCB business card that contains my name, LinkedIn, gmail, and Instagram tags. There is an NFC chip and an LED that will light up once the chip is scanned. I plan to program the NFC chip to lead to my LinkedIn profile, so that I can add people on LinkedIn by tapping their phones.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The subtotal for the five assembled PCBs will cost $18.62. With the cheapest shipping option to Canada, the grand total is $30.96.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The design process was a little diffuclt at first, but the tutorial was very helpful and I got used to the software quickly. I tried to design my business card to be farily professional and minimal as I am going off to college soon and wanted this card to reflect some maturity as I dive into a new chapter of my life. I included my Instagram and LinkedIn profiles to the soldermask layer as I will be meeting many new faces in college, so I wanted this card to help me connect with others.
