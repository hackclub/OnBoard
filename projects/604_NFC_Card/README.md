# NFC Hacker Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My board is a credit card sized NFC device that can transmit links or data to devices. It also has an LED that will light up when NFC is used. I added my robotics team's logo for fun.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The order total right now is $29.44.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The biggest challenge was figuring out how to layout all parts so that autorouting worked correctly. Following diagrams and looking very closely at the board helps a lot.
