# Andrew's PCB NFC CARD
## Summary
##### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
I am making a pcb business card with nfc functionality to open my personal portfolio on contact with an nfc supported device. It also features a qr code to my github as well as providing my email, linkedin, and website.

## Plan
##### How much is it going to cost?
The pcbs will cost **$40.85** which includes shipping with Global Standard Direct Line for $9.62 and an SMT Special Offer for -$9.00.

## Design
##### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional***
This was my first time developing a PCB and it was a really fun experience! I'll definitely be trying to design even more PCBs in the future. I faced some challenges with drawing traces but figured it out. Taking physics also definitely helped with understanding how the board works haha. I designed my board after my love of ducks and tried to keep it as clean as possible so it wouldn't feel cluttered.
