# PCB Business/Hacker Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
PCB designed using EasyEDA functioning as a 'smart' business card. It utilizes an NFC chip paired with an antenna to prompt others' devices to open my personal website (https://aleksanderkurgan.vercel.app/) which I also designed for arcade :). 

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The board will cost $30.96

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
