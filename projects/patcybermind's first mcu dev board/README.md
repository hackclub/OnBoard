# Pat's mcu

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
this is my second ever pcb!
the goal is for it to work as a dev board so that i can work my way up to a fully featured flight controller and maybe even flight computer sometime in the future
i want to learn how to flash the bootloader and do simple stuff on something thats as simple as possible and works as a base platform
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
It took me forever to route the whole thing, ive never been good at wiring stuff digitally nor physically lol, there were points where i got stuck and really wasnt sure how to get two wires connected
i had to move a lot of things around but i managed to connect everything at the end.
