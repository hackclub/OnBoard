# Pico MMU Control Board

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

The board controls a servo and stepper motor using Klipper. To control the stepper motor it uses a TMC2209 driver board. The project is for the Pico MMU unit.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

The board is $16 CAD, parts are $20 CAD on Digikey and shipping is $30 as I need it ASAP.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
