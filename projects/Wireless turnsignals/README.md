# Wireless turnsignals ("trådlösa blinkers" in swedish)

I have made system to allow a trailer connected to a excevator to stil have its lights working, while the excevator is rotating. 
The excevator dosen't have an electrical system on its undercarriage, so if i just had a wire from the excevator to the trailer, the wire would get all tangled up as soon as the excevator started to rotate. 
The system is made up of two parts, a transmitter on the excavaror and a reciver on the trailer.

PCB & BCBA: $43.44
Shipping: $6.88
Taxes: $12.58
Total: $62.90

The harest part about the projekt was to make the transmitter as small as possible to be able to fit it in a standard connector.

Ps. excuse my bad english (im from Sweden).
