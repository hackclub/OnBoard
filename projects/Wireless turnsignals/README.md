# Wireless turnsignals ("trådlösa blinkers" in swedish)

I have made system to allow a trailer connected to a excevator to stil have its lights working, while the excevator is turning. 
The excevator dosen't have an electrical system on its undercarriage, so if i had an traditonal wire from the excevator to the trailer, the wire would get all tangled up as soon as it started to turn. 
The system is made up of to parts, a transmitter on the excavaror and a reciver on the trailer.

It is going to cost $62.90, mostly becuse i hade to make 2 different pcbs and use some special parts.

PCB & BCBA: $43.44
Shipping: $6.88
Taxes: $12.58
Total: $62.90

The harest part about the projekt was to make the transmitter as small as possible to be able to fit it in a standard connector (hope i didn't make i to small so it dosen't work lol).

Ps. plz excuse my bad english (im form Sweden).
