 My board is a buissness card with a OWSKI written in the top left and a led light on the "i" in owski. It also has a QR code to my website, my github username, and my other website link. It also had the logo of my website cover the right half of the card.What are you making? What will it do? 

 cost = $38.95 

 I found the tutorials super helpful becuase i had to learn easyeda for the first time
