# SMART RING PCB"

Board Description
This is a custom PCB designed for a wearable health monitoring system that integrates sensors and wireless communication. The board includes an nRF52840 microcontroller, a heart rate sensor, and a USB interface for debugging and power. It is compact and optimized for low power consumption, making it ideal for battery-powered applications.

Cost Estimate
The estimated cost for PCB fabrication and assembly is around $57.52, depending on the component selection and assembly options at JLCPCB.

Design Process & Challenges (Optional)
One of the biggest challenges was ensuring USB debugging functionality while keeping the design compact. Proper routing of power and signal traces was crucial for reliable operation. Using KiCad/Altium, along with JLCPCB's parts library, helped streamline the design and minimize errors.
