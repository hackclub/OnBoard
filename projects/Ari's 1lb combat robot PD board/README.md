# 1lb Combat Robot Power Distribution Board

I'm making a simple (and tiny) power distribution board for my antweight combat robot. It will connect the battery
to the weapon motor ESC and drive motor ESCs. This will make wiring easier and less likely to break apart

Total cost is $22.13

I already designed a much more complicated PCB for my geocache project that was also funded by Onboard.
This made designing ad PD board very easy
