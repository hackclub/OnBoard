# 9-key Macropad

## Summary
The board is a macropad with 9 kailh switches (similar to cherry mx) a rotary encoder. It's powered by a Pi Pico and will use CircuitPython.

## Plan
Board Production: $5.20
Assembly for 2: $48.18
Tax: $4.06
Shipping: $23.26
Total: $80.70

## Design
I started out by making a traditional PCB, with each switch routed to a separate pin. However, some folks in the onboard slack channel were able to help me with updating the design to a matrix instead, allowing for a cleaner design. I also learned about nets during the process, cleaning up my schematic.
