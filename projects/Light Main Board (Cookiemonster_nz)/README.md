# Light Main Board

This is a board for a dmx fixture I've been making from scratch. Originally, I designed it and just linked together a bunch of led's using speaker cable, but they kept cracking and the thermal dissipation was terrible. 
I designed this pcb to solve both of these problems, it holds the leds, and is also an aluminum core board, and combined with some heatsinks i've bought, should provide adequate de-hotting. 
It takes in the pwm signals from an off board led driver, and powers 12 rgb, and 12 white leds, for a total power output of 96w. 

Total Cost: $26.63
