# Lizzie's Clouds PCB

My PCB is a project I made in my school's Hack Club which is run by my friends. I want to use it for fun purposes and to show to my friends that I actually made something cool.

It will cost $19.19

I don't really know anything about coding so I didn't really understand what I was doing and was just following powerpoints. However I had a lot of help from my really smart coding friends, I would not have been able to make this without them.
I did know how to design it and making the actual design on Canva was really fun and is one thing I can actually do.
