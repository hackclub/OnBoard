# Bogget's Toolkit - Multimeter

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
The PLATYMETER is a multimeter with 3 modes for measuring resistance, current, and voltage. The built in buzzer provides an audible cue to check for continuity and pin headers allow for mods like an OLED display.
