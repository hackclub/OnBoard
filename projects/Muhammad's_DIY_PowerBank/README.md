# PROJECT NAME
## Summary
##### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
My project is basically a USB Type C Power Bank which I will probably make myself and solder components in the end. I plan to use 3-4 18650 cells to power it and then 3D print a nice case for it.

## Plan
##### How much is it going to cost? What's your timeline?
I assume for a single until with no mistakes the total cost would be around £3. With all components included it will cost around £10 per board along with assembly since I don't have the tools to solder it at home myself :(

## Design
##### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional**
