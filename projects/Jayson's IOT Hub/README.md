# Jayson's IOT Hub

This is an IOT hub and module. The hub has a screen, some buttons, an sd card slot, and a buck converter from 2.7-5.5 to 3.3v, this is all controlled by an esp32 s3. Then there is the module which has teh same buck converter and is also run by an esp32 s3, although this has all of the other pins going to a pinout to then be connected to anything such as a motor controller and motors(which is what I plan on doing).

The price for the board itself(from JLCPCB) is $27.5 and the parts(ordered separately from JLCPCB) are $35, not including shipping
