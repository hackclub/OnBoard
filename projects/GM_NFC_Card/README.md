# GM's PCB NFC Card

- This is my first PCB project, an NFC business card. The card features an LED bulb, a barcode that links to my LinkedIn profile, and includes my contact information such as phone number, email, and GitHub username. The card also has images and additional design elements to enhance its appearance.

- The total cost of the project, including shipping, was approximately $65.

- As this was my first experience creating a PCB, I encountered several challenges. However, @maggie's tutorial was incredibly helpful. Overall, it was a fun and engaging process.
