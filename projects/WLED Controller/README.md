# Esp32 WLED Controller

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My board is a simple board, powered by an ESP32 MCU, a micro controller by espressif. It's going to control up to 4 channels of addressable LEDs, it will use relays to save power, it also has a built in level shifter for signal integrity

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Without taxes and shipping it will cost around 60 dollars, with them around 92 dollars sadly.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The main challenge was all the pcb making, the schematic was kinda easy having studied it in school
