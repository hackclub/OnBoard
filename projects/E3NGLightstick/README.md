# E3NG Lightstick

I got tired of LED strips. Super finicky, delecate solder pads, etc. I decided to make a LED stick that fits the E3NG and it makes wiring simple. All it is is basically a row of neopixels on a stick.

3 Boards will cost about $28, and for the capacitors and LEDs is about $20 in total.
Capacitors x25 $5: https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/murata-electronics/GRM21B7U1A104JA01L/2546740 
LEDs x25 $15: https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sparkfun-electronics/COM-16347/11630204
