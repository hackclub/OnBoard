# Hallodweeno

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

Arduino + Halloween = **Hallodweeno** ! ~ YAY!!!

**Hallodweeno** is a pumpkin-shaped Arduino board featuring SK6812-E LEDs along its edges. The LEDs are connected to pin 2, and you can program them to create your own spooky light effects. Since the board doesnâ€™t include a built-in programmer, you'll need to connect it to an external Arduino or programmer. Additionally, you could add a buzzer to make eerie sounds and take the spookiness to the next level!

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

- PCB: $61.34  
- Shipping: $17.29
- Total (with $10 coupon applied): $68.63

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->

Coming up with the idea for a pumpkin-shaped Arduino board was challenging, and some design elements required extra effort. Fortunately, I received great help from my Hack Club community and friends. The most difficult part was the wiring, which took a significant amount of time to get right.
