# 1.4 Amp Laser Driver

This is my first attempt at a precision current regulating PCB used to drive 1+ watt laser diodes! It might not work because there's likely a lot of things I did not consider properly when making such a precise device, but that's part of the learning curve! Here's to hoping it works. 

Cost: $42.87 Dollars
