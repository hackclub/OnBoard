# FRC CAN Distribution PCB


It is a PCB for FRC that help us to easily wire CAN. The last season we make a prototype and now were trying to improve them.

Merchandising total is $30.52 and Shipping Estimated is $38.86 giving a total of $69.38 (Dollars).

We had a little bit of complications because at the beginning we had another and better design but the components for assemblies run out of stock, then this is the remake.
