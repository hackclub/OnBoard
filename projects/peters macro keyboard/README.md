Peter's Macro Keyboard

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? --> It will be a macro keyboard that I can use to more easily open apps I frequently use on my computer. I will use circuitpython on the pico.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? --> $61.37 for the board. $36.63 for shipping costs. $98.00 total. I then have a $10 PCBA coupon I can apply which brings the total down to $88.00

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
