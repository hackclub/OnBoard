# LianaNCFCard

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? --> 
My board is an NCF Card that once tapped against a phone will actvate and bring up a link. The link will be a YouTube video of my robotics team dancing to Sweet Caroline. :)

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
According to JLPCB, it will cost about $53.09.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Wiring and doing the vias were really really hard. Putting the designs on the silk layer was fun though. I've attempted to make this card multiple times, and I'll be really happy when I finally make it work.
