# Dylan's NFC Card

I thought it would be a cool idea to create a NFC card for myself after my friend, @eddyzow, showed me his design. I thought he did a great job and that it was extremely interesting to see how all of this worked, so I designed a business card/NFC card, similar to his.
After a lot of work, editing, and tweaking, I ended up with a result I am quite proud of.

The total cost is $32.79, with most of it going to shipping. 

I took inspiration from Eddy's design (which was extremely helpful!) and the tutorial linked above. I mostly used google drawings and a lot of background remover to transparent png in order to do what I could. Since I am extremely new to this type of thing, I was not exactly sure how to do everything, but I ended up with a result I am happy with.
