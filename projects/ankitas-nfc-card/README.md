# MY NFC CARD

I made a NFC card that can redirect people to my blog, so they can learn more about me and reach out to me. I'm going to be giving some of these out at a meeting I'm soon going to, so it will helpful and cool!
It costs $42.14 dollars for 5 to be made fully assembled.
It was my first time making a PCB and I tried adding some extra LEDs and it was a challenge making all the connections.
