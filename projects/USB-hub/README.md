# PROJECT NAME
## Summary
##### This is a 4 port usb hub featuring usb 2.0.

## Plan
##### The PCB is going to cost $44.75.

## Design
##### In my opinion navigating EasyEDA's part selector was difficult at first since I was overwhelmed by the sheer options. Trying to route traces on the PCB was also dificult as this is my first time doing so. ***Totally optional***
