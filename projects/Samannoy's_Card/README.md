# Samannoy's Card

Its basically a NFC card with which you can like flash off links to your websites, phone numbers, basically anything with RFID technology.

It costs around $45.28

There were a lot of DRC errors like close pads and tracks, I had to solve them also I went for manual routing which was a very tedious process.
