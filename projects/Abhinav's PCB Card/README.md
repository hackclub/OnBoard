# Abhinav's PCB Card

This is the first PCB Board that I am making. I am utilizing the skills I learned from the tutorial to create a business card that sends out a URL on tap and lights up!

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

This was a gratifying process. I loved messing around with the different components and figuring out how to put them together. And I found that the most challenging part was when I had to connect the components of the schematic together in the PCB, as I was encountering some design conflicts that took me a while to resolve. But, it taught me a lot more about PCB's overall, and I was able to build my first PCB.
