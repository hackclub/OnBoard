# Zenless Zone Zero Hollow Zero Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This card is inspired by the game Zenless Zone Zero made by Mihoyo. I plan to use this card for things like cosplay, and also to give out to some of my family members for fun. I will proabably link it to my social media, or maybe perhaps a website if I can get a domain (god domains have been so expensive ever since Google Domains shut down).
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$30.38 CAD (incl shipping, before taxes)
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
