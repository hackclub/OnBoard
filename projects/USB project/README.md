I am making a PCB board and it will transmit a URL on tap and light up.

$37.47
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I based my project on one of my favortie shows "One Piece". The hardest part was to find good images.
