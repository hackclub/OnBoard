# Isobel's USB Hub

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My first attempt at a PCB. A USB hub that I'll (hopefully!) also use as a makeshift business card. Just followed the tutorial, and tried to add my own design. 

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Delivery and assembly ended up being very expensive so it should be around around $45 (I got $45.40 quote.)

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I made this a while back but the submission process ended up taking a long time... Making this was so fun, and I made a bunch of different designs before I settled on this one. This *seems* like a really hard thing to get into but `#electronics ` was really helpful, and made it so easy for me to get into designing PCBs. I plan to use the other half of my grant to make my own new projects in the future!
