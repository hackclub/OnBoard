# Vibelt

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
The board has a 2x20 SMT header, which will be used to connect to the RPi 4, along with 8 sets fo 4 through holes to connect to an ultrasonic sensor and 8 sets of 3 through holes for vibration motors. 
The overall project is to make a belt to guide the blind by vibrating in the direction of an obstacle, and this we are making a prototype. It connects the RPi headers to the through holes as needed to we have a simple and less messy and reliableconnections than with a breadboard

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The boards will cost $43.89 total. 

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->

It was really challenging to get started with understanding our circuit diagrams and pcb design worked, as this is the first time any of us (group of 3) have worked in this field, we come from backgrounds of CAD and software. Online tutorials really helped, as well as the electronics channel
