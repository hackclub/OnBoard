# Elauncher

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentencs. What are you making? What will it do? -->
The board uses mosfets to actuate high current coils. We are making a coil launcher that sorts trash.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The board going to cost around 23 dollars because of 2 oz outer copper weight for high amperage and another probably 20 dollars for the manufacturing equating and maybe 5 dollars for shipping so around 50 dollars?


<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
