#ShivaPrakash_Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
Made my own PCB Business Card following Maggie's tutorial :). When the board gets near the nfc reader of a phone, it harvests energy from it and lights up the led and opens a link on the phone.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
41.86 CAD
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Hmm, the most challenging part was probably the aesthetics I kept going back and forth through a lot of designs but the one I landed on at the end I liked a lot so :D
