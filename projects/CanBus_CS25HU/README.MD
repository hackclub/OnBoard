# CanBus CanSat Connection Board

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
For out CanSat design, we needed a board which fits in the required size and routes power and IÂ²C/UART to our sensors.
This ensures that we fit in the weight and size limitations for the competition.
Oh and also, how else would we add cool easter eggs to our CanSat?

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
| PCB+Shipping   | 29.85$ |
|----------------|--------|
| Parts+Shipping | 45.85$ |
| Total          | 75.7$  |

It could be cheaper with Regular shipping, but we are really running out of time and would need to demo this by next week.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->

My first challenge was that I'm a total beginner in this. Also I got pretty ill while finishing the project, but The show must go on!
