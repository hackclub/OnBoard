# Sayhan Rahman's PCB Hacker Card
![Image of Card](https://github.com/hackclub/OnBoard/blob/main/projects/sayhan_rahman/card.gif?raw=true)

This is a simple PCB business card with NFC antenna in it. Follows Maggie's tutorial on Hack Club Jams but the design is almost completely my own. 

Note that this is me ordering it for the second time because last time some problems in the PCB made it completely dysfunctional. I missed a 2 vias and the circuits didn't work. I tried to fix the cards manually by making holes and soldering connections, but it didn't work too good either. 

## So if you're reviewing this, kindly take the time to ensure the card will work. I'd appreciate it greatly :)

Including shipping, it should cost a maximum of $50 from JLCPCB. ~~Prices have increased ðŸ˜­~~

~~So, having never desinged PCBs much before, I definitely struggled with wiring the components. I had some experience with Hackpad but it definitely wasn't enough. But kind people exists in #electronics and they sure did help me out.~~ This is my second time ordering the same thing. I missed my the VIA because EasyEDA doesn't autoform vias when switching layers during wiring, unlike KiCAD. And this cost me quite a bit of extra work to mess around :):
