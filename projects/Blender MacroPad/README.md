# Blender Macropad

This board is a macro pad I can use for blender as I am learning how to do 3d design in blender.
This will help with short cuts and improving my workflow.
I'm planning on making this customizable with different layouts so I can also use it for editing workflows as well as an extension for coding.

This (pcb) will cost around \$16 dollars, I may make a future revision with more buttons depending on how well it works.
The microcontroller is only around \$5 dollars

I spent a while learning how to design this and also followed the qmk guide as well as some youtube videos (I dont remember exactly which)
I think it would be really cool to have my own board that I designed and I want to start small.
I may also 3d print a case for this.
