# Average NFC Thing

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
A little keychain trinket that I will probably link to my socials or something. All it is, is just an nfc antenna, a capacitor and a chip.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
After submitting the pcb design and checking out it only costs ~5$ cad.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
