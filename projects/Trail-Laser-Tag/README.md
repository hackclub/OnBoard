# Trail Laser Tag Project

# Project Overview
The Trail Laser Tag project involves creating custom PCBs for a laser tag system. These boards are designed to be used in a laser tag game, where they will handle functions such as detecting hits, communicating with other devices, and managing game rules.

# Cost Breakdown
The detailed cost breakdown for the project, including PCBs and their assembly, is as follows:

- PCB prototype for GERBER_Y5: $5.53 for 5 units \n
- Economic PCBA for GERBER_Y5: $18.72 for 5 units
- PCB prototype for GERBER_Y4: $3.53 for 5 units (special offer)
- Economic PCBA for GERBER_Y4: $18.42 for 5 units
- Total Merchandise Cost: $46.20

- Additional costs include:

- Shipping Estimate: $21.31 (DHL Express Worldwide, 2-4 business days)
- Customs duties & taxes: $16.88
- Grand Total: $84.39

# Design and Manufacturing Process

- Schematic Design: Creating detailed circuit schematics using PCB design software.
- PCB Layout: Designing the physical layout of the PCB, ensuring that all components fit within the specified dimensions and that the routing of the electrical connections is efficient.
- Prototyping: Ordering initial prototypes to test the design and functionality.

# Challenges and Solutions
- Component Placement: Ensuring that all components fit within the limited space on the PCB required careful planning and multiple iterations of the layout.
- Signal Integrity: Managing signal integrity and minimizing interference required strategic routing and the use of ground planes.
- Cost Management: Balancing the need for high-quality components and services with budget constraints involved selecting the most cost-effective options without compromising on quality.

The project aims to produce reliable and efficient laser tag system components, ready for integration and use in trail project at [trail.hackclub.com](https://trail.hackclub.com/).
