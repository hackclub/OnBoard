# DJL_SENSORHUB

I am Making a Sensor Hub for simple HIGH/LOW Sensors like Infrared B/W Sensors or Buttons
It Routes the Sensor Cables (GND / +5v / SIGNAL) to a central Power input and 4 Signal Outs

Price:
18.15$ Without Shipping (THIS)
(Ive done 2 Projects so i dont waste shipping fees)
(go to projects/DJL_HackerCard)

I do Robotics.
I participate in the Robocup
In this years Project i needed to use an Array of B/W Sensors
This meant that i need to route another cable for each of the 12 existing cables (they are connected into blocks of three GND/VIN/SIG)
That was Yesterday.
So i decided to try out OnBoard
I first looked on JLC whitch Male and Female Connector arrays would be the right ones
then i created the Schematic, routing everighing.
Then i tranfered everighing on a PCB and Arranged everithing
i at first forgot to add holes to mount it.
I even added my Robotics Logo (that was the first artpice in 9,5 Years in school i am proud of) inspired by the BluesBrothers Hats (was my first successfull Robocup Prj)

Summary:
Was Fun, Would Recommend to my Future Club.
Learning Curve isnt too High if you Worked with Simmilar Tools.
