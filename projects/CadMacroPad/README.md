# CAD Macropad

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am making my own custom macropad to make CAD, aka Computer Aided Design or CAD programs such as solidworks, inventor, onshape, ect, easier. This PCB is will be used to hook up the 23 Cherry MX switches to the Arduino Pro Micro in a matrix layout. Orginally I was going to hand wire the entire project but I have never used a PCB in one of my projects and wanted to give it a shot.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
According to JLC PCB about $13.9 not including taxes.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Basicly I did what most espiring engineers do in this day and age, look it up on youtube and figure it out from there.
