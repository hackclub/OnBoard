# 4x4 Keyboard

This is a 4x4 Keyboard that I intend to use for gaming, the switch positions match the keycaps of the characters that I decided that I needed.

Manafacture will cost $76.67 USD for the minimum quantity of 5 boards.

The first hurdle was deciding what keys I wanted, initially I was going to make a keyboard just for the WASD keys, but I decided that I might aswell use the full potential of the ATMEGA32U4 board and decided to do 16 keys.
Once I knew the keys that I wanted, spacing and design of the switch placement was easy thanks to how many tools there are on the internet that help.
Developing the PCB was a bit harder, I went through many itterations before reaching my final design.
