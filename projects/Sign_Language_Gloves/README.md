# Sign Language Gloves (For ASL)

Hi there, I'm making some gloves with some bunch of mpu6050s to detect an hand gesture to recognise american sign language. I need this board
to make my device more portable so folks can use it more easily :)

The board on its own from JLCPCB is going to cost $2, but with shipping it's costing $42.44

I honestly never was into electronics, but ASL recognition through gestures felt like an fun summer project to work on. so I saw some
videos online on understanding circuits in general, used a breadboard for awhile to make some dumb projects to mess around with, and I
made the sign language gloves with an breadboard! but I wanted to make it portable through which I thought PCBs are EPICC, I learned a bit
of EasyEDA actually from a friend who also helped me design the circuit and after like a week of playing around I felt that I made a really good
board! :D
