# j4y's NFC card!
I made this NFC card using the tutorial on the site, I think it turned out pretty good.  
It will cost around $78.65 USD

**NOTE: I removed a qr code in the final files, because I also wanted this card to work as a kind of alternate student ID, and even though the QR code only contains a UUID, I still removed it as a precaution.**
