<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

This is a project I was capable of constructing through a workshop hosted by my school's STEM club. It's a PCB that lights up, sedning users a link. 

<!-- How much is it going to cost? --> 

$31.48

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->

There was some issues when attempting to gather the parts required for making the PCB, apart from that - it went rather smoothly.
