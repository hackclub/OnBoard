# LightBulb Initative PCB 

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
The boards I am making is for my club LightBulb Initiative. The purpose of this design is to send these PCB boards to the disadvantaged children in India to get their hands on real circuits to get experience. This design is the default design as I believe that the default design will be easier for the kids to understand and take a look at. 
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Cost for board and shipping is $60.09
