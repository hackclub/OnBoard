# PROJECT NAME
## Summary
I'm making a personal NFC card, following Maggie's NFC Business Card tutorial.
The PolyCard will display some basic information about myself and it will also have an NFC chip that people can read wth their phones for contact information.

## Plan
Fabrication and assembly will cost $20.54, plus shipping which will be $17.03, for a total of $37.57.

## Design
I started following Maggie's NFC Business Card tutorial. It was a little confusing at first since I have never designed a PCB before, but I was able to get a basic schematic and PCB designed.
After that, the challenge was simply designing and decorating. It took me a while to design something that I liked. EasyEDA was also a little buggy at times - next time, I'll try using KiCAD.
