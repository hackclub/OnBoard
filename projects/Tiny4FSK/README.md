# Tiny4FSK

Tiny4FSK aims to run on 1x AAA battery to transmit 4FSK signals on the amateur radio band, allowing for high-altitiude tracking systems for high-altitude systems.

The board itself costs $7, with $17.80 shipping. In total, the board costs $26.35 with tax and shipping included.

Ahh, I've been working on this since August, trying to use the SI4063 in code to get the drivers right.
