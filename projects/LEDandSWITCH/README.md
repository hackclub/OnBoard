# LEDandSWICH

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is my first PCB project, so I started with simple LED that you can turn on and off with switch!
You flip the switch to power the LED.
I tried to design it to be look like some kind of key.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
36.80USD total

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
It was my first time using EasyEDA, so I struggled while trying to make board outline symmetricl. I managed to do it with grid snapping.
