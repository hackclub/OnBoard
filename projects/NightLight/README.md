# USB NIGHT LIGHT

A USB night light for use when I'm up late coding/cadding. It is switch activated and uses a USB power source

$21.14

I followed the tutorial for the most part, but I ran into a issue pertaining to stock on JLCPCB, so I had to source a seperate switch for the project. the Slack was very helpful.
