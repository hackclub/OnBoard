# PCB Circle Art Piece

I made a mini-PCB art piece. You can hand it on your wall. It will be programmed to take you to my contact info (or maybe other purpose, will decide software later). It's meant primarily to be visually appealing.

This would be an NFC wall art with a light that shines when the user taps their phone to the NFC. 

It's going to cost $27.00 (5.4 dollars per board). I am making 5 boards. The purpose is this is that I am going to share the boards with friends, HQ folks, & family as a gift. 

I turned some AI art I made into an SVG & slapped some text onto it. It's meant to be pretty fun & playful.
