# 65% Gasket Mounted Custom Keyboard (that has a non conventional layout)

I made a 65% mechanical keyboard that has a 7u spacebar, split backspace, and a less conventional layout to other 65% keyboards out there. I designed this keyboard for what i wanted in regards to functionality, (no numpad, no funciton key row, etc.)

$150.63... ($94.68 PCB + $55.95 shipping)

This was my first time using any sort of EDA tool suite, so I had to learn EasyEDA (it's pretty intuitive!). I followed ai03's PCB design guide, but i extrapolated it from a 4 key macropad to a 71 key keyboard. I also got a lot of help from the Utah mechanical keyboard scene (they have a discord!). Along with EasyEDA, I used Onshape to design the plates and the case for the keyboard. I'm planning on manufacturing the case myself with my FRC team's new router (that is hopefully going to come soon), but i'm taking advantage of JLCPCB to manufacture a FR-4 plate for me (i cant really hold that good of a tolerance). I'm doing this by just importing my plate into EasyEDA and exporting as a gerber, so there are no traces or anything on the PCB and it's just the board outline.
