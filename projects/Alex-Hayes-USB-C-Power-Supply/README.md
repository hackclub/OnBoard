<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I made a USB-C 5V power supply. I will be using it to power bread board projects via usb-c.

This will cost $22.63 including shipping

The challenge was learning how to hook up the usb-c connector and using the easyeda software.
