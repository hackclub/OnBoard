# Auto-Stirrer

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is our project for the trail. It will allow us to automate making our food, by mixing it, setting a timer, and alerting the user when their food is done.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$51.88 (We can bring it down ~$10 if we can source a cheaper part that's currently out of stock.)
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The most challenging part was making the motor circuit as, at first, we weren't sure what exactly we needed. Furthermore, it was somewhat difficult to route it as we needed 2 layers.
