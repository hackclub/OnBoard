# PCB USB HUB

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I have made a USB hub pcb from easyeda by tutorial by maxwofford and will be shipping it though POWERPCB

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Around $58


<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I faced challanges during the wiring connection of the pcb but members on Hackclub Slack helped me out :)
