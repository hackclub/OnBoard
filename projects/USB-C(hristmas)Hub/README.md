# USB-C(hristmas)Hub

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
A simple USB Hub with some inspiration from the tutorial. I'm submitting this to Hacky Holidays because I added Christmas decorations on both sides. The shape of the PCB is also a Christmas tree with some LEDs

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
39.08$ + 17.62$ for Shipping = 56.70$

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
