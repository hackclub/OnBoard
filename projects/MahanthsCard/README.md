# Mahanth's Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I made a business card that has an NFC chip that, when tapped on, will send a link to my LinkedIn profile and have an LED on the card light up.
This is meant to help me stand out while networking and have a unique, business card that I can re-use. 

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Based on JLCPCB, this will cost $3.73 with the most economical shipping option. 

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Was easy for the most part. Was kind of confused when I accidentally chose an antenna with exposed copper, but the slack helped me fix that. I liked
designing it and look forward to future PCBs.
