# YOUR PROJECT NAME
Encoder for FTC

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
What this is an encoder for FTC. This can be used in several ways such as for absolute encoder modes or tracking the position for the robot. It has 2 ports so it can be used for absolute mode and quadrature. I am planning to use this for swerve drive.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$49.51 for the first iteration **and hopefully the last** lol. I made sure that if I needed a second version I could use the other half for a v2.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
ill come back and add it, just want to get this submitted so I can get it done asap lol
