# Small stepper motor breakout board

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My board is just 4 wires that will make it easier to test software for a small stepper motor I am using in some projects.
You can find the motor at " https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09CTT8Z2G ".

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The PCB is going to cost 2 dollars for 5 and the motors were 8 dollars for 10.
