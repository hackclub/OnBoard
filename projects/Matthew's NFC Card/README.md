# NFC Business Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My board is a business card that can transmit a URL on tap and light up. I plan to configure so that it transmits my LinkedIn link on tap so I can hit 500+ connections :D
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$30.96
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Maggie did a great job explaining the basics of creating a hacker card. I found that using a mix of Canva and Figma really helped for the design process.
