# Pour Cup PCB

For a project in school, we're helping a school that is for special needs kids that may not have the motor control they need, so they have a bendable arm that can pour a cup. However, these are expensive, AND they constantly break. So, I was tasked to make a new board that would A. Be a drop in replacement and B. more reliable. One thing I noticed was all these boards are are a 555 timer and an h bridge, now all I need is to make the PCB I designed.

3 boards will cost around $10 to make and the parts all together are about $3.
