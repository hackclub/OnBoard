# Prajwal's Hacker Card

I made an NFC card following the tutorial linked above. It has my name, contact details, and a few components.

price: $21.50
shipping: $18.80
total: $40.30

timeline: 3-5 business days

It was straightforward to follow the tutorial! I didn't have any trouble designing this project.
