# Ultra USB Hub

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
The USB hub tutorial but far larger with 4 USB ports instead of 2. This will allow for even more USBs to plug into just one port (especially for my surface pro). Also has some nice silk layers for aesthetic. 

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
â‰ˆ$25 USD per order. 

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I struggled initially to use the EasyEDA interface but messing around with EasyEDA certainly helped to make progress in making the design. The Hack Club tutorials were also really helpful.
