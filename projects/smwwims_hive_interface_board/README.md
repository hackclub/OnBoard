# HIVE Interface Board
## Summary
Iâ€™m currently trying to build a Hexapod Platform (also known as Stewart Platform). I have a Raspberry Pi as a controller and six linear actuators to drive the platform. In order to connect the linear actuators with the motor drivers and the motor drivers with the raspberry in a clean and organized way, I have designed an interface board.

## Plan
| Type of Cost  | Cost   |
| ------------- | ------ |
| PCBs          | $8.70  |
| Shipping      | $17.70 |
| Customs       | $5.28  |
| Discount      |-$10.10 |
| Total         | $21.58 |

## Design
What helped me when designing my interface board was just analyzing other interface boards, like the Arduino Shields.
