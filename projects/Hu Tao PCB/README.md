# Hu Tao PCB Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
Hu Tao themed hacker card. I spent quite a few hours on this design, and the planned functionality is for the card to give a link to my personal buy me a coffee type site that's Hu Tao-themed.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$29.64

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Following the tutorial to make the pcb was mostly easy, but figuring out how the different layers worked and how everything would look like was quite confusing at first. I spent almost 10 hours designing the card's front and back side to look good in black and white.
