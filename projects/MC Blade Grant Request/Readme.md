# Matthew-PCB

I am making a chip that blinks LEDS in sequence using a 555 timer chip, and it will blink 20 of them in sequence, 2 at a time. This is a project to get us aquanted with the 555 chip and PCB Designing in general. It is supposed to look really cool.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

$51.84 - inlcuidng shipping
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Some challenges that I had were figuring out what it would look like cosmetically, and I got inspiration from the internet. Another challenge was having the wrong type of LED, since the one we had was out of stock and we had to get a new one
