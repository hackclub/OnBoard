# SpookyGhost

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
im making SpookyGhost for TrickOrTrace (you can check the cart its dated for the 4th im just in a diff timezone i swear)
so basically its a led,switch,resister, 2 batteries and a rumble motor (who needs those buzzers when you can rrrrrumble)
the design is a twist on how a ghost says "boo" since mine says "rumble" as a way to scare people (yes i drew it myself)

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$45.81
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
so i tried to make a hackercard before this but it got rejected for some rando reason (the reviewer prob made a mistake since he deleted his pr comment)
some challenges were that i was kinda doubting my routing skills until i learned about the auto router lol
