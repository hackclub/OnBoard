# Hacker_Card_Arp

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am making a simple Hacker card/NFC business card as a gift for my robotics team. It uses NFC to give you info about stuff when scanned 
and can be reprogrammed as many times as you want in theory.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? —->
$31.77 with shipping due to JLC pcb smt assembly service also.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally Optional*** -->
I struggled with using vias and routing traces but eventually got there with some practice. The DRC stuff also broke my brain a bit but I figured it out.
