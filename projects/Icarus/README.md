# PROJECT NAME
## Summary
##### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
Was a Meshtastic compatible PCB for my personal project which I am now submitting for Trick and Trace. Uses and ESP32-S3 and LoRa RA-01SH
## Plan
##### How much is it going to cost?
Total including assembly is around $98
## Design
##### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional***
I based it around the ESP32S3 as it is performant and easily avaliable. I plan to 3D print the casing. The board uses LoRa to enable longrange communication in remote areas where sattelite phones are banned. The project is for my A-Level DT NEA. I am submitting to trick and trace so I can get funding for tools :)
