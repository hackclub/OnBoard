# RP2040 LTE Communicator

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My project is a 4-layer cellular mobile device that I intend on replacing my personal cellphone. The board itself is designed to be a drag-and-drop replacement for an analog phone shell. My board uses LTE CAT-1 NA bands and an RP2040.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
PCB: $27.60, Stencil: $28.29, Components (LCSC): $51.00 (excluding shipping)
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
My design process consisted of organizing the project (Power, Microcontroller, LTE), choosing ICs that would work for my project, drawing the schematics with help from the components' respective datasheets, and placing them on the PCB.<br><hr>
Some challenges were: Selecting suitable ICs, Impedence and Stack control (my first 4-layer), PCB mechanical layout (drag-and-drop)
