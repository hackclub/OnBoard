# Pixel art display

its a led matrix diplay with neopixels

oder total is 37 $ but will increase when i add the neopixels 
as we need to preorder them so i can not get the price with all assembeled

As for the challenges, this was my 1st pcb without any help. This one took me a bit of time as I learned about things like enopixels pull ups and pull down. but it was fun overall!
also I will design a case for this pcb and will print that
