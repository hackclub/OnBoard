# YOUR PROJECT NAME

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
# I built this hacker card following the hacker card jam tutorial online! Not only will it function similarly to a business card, but I've also added access to my resume via the QR code, making it easy to access for any prospects
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
# I'm running a club with around 15 people, and each card would cost around 2 dollars
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
