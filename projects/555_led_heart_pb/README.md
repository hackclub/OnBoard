# 555_led_chaser_heart

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My circuit board is a printable circuit board with 10 leds on it. The timer makes it so that the leds start lighting up from the first LED and turns off and then turns on the next LED continously till it hits the last LED and starts over. The 555 determines the frequency of the changing of the LEDs.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
27.98 USD
