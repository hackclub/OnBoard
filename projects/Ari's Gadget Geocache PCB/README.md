# Gadget Geocache PCB

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am making a PCB that connects the user interfaces with a gadget geocache to an arduino. It has ports for the power input,
buttons, LED's, SD card, and the arduino itself. It will really help to simplify the wiring in my gadget geocache that I'm
making for a local makerspace.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The total cost is about $60 dollars for the minium 5 pcb's from JLCPCB. Hopefully it will work the first time.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I started this project completely new to pcb design and even electronics in general. It really helped that I was enthusiastic
and excited to complete this project because I spent many hours researching, prototyping, and designing this PCB. I bought a 
breadboard to test the circuit before I submitted this to troubleshoot and make sure my design would work. It was difficult
to find all the parts for it that JLCPCB had in stock and figure out how to control high power components with an arduino.
