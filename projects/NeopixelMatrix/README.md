<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$99.38


<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
This is my first full PCB, I didn't watch/read any tutorial, only a bit of the Kicad Docs. The process of creating the pcb wasn't hard, something wich i didn't like, bc was too repetitive was when connecting the components, this was tedious. Also a challange was uploading it to JLCPCB bc kicad's BOM isn't compatible with them, and had to search for a script to adapt it.
