# Nikhil_InfoCard

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My board uses a NFC chip for people to scan the card and it will open my linkedin profile on their phone. It also has some basic contact info on it and a QR code to my website.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
In total, it will cost $37.85 for 5 cards.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
This design was challenging because I have never designed a PCB before. I got lots of help on the HackClub slack for this project.
