# Water Quality Checker

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
Building a water quality checker for the Trail which uses TDS, Turbidity and temperature sensors to assess water quality.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Before the actual sensors and the RPi Pico and the TDS controller board, including shipping it's coming out to $78.54.
However I have almost zero expectation for it to work first try and will likely need to do revisions which idk how I'll pay for.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Got a lot of help from the Slack. Learnt everything I now know about PCBs during this project.
