# Konstantinos Business Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I created a PCB business card with NFC following the tutorial by Maggie Liu. It uses an NFC chip, a printed NFC antenna and a small capacitor to transmit the url of my website to any smartphone that taps it. I want to share it with my friends as I am sure, nobody will have seen a similar business card.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The pcb will cost a little over $20.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The design process wasn't very difficult. It's my first time designing a pcb but after following the tutorial and playing around with EasyEDA, I got the hang of it.
