<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

This board is a logic learning platform. There is a buck converter that goes from 9V to 5V and the rest is wired for 4 gate IC's
There are switches and leds with the necessary power already wired so the focus is on logic and not on electricity.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$103.85 (i assume i can cover the extra)

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
