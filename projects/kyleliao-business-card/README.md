# Kyle's NFC Business Card
## Summary
##### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
My NFC Business Card is a 2 layer PCB. It has an antenna and IC for NFC that I plan on using as a digital business card. 

## Plan
##### How much is it going to cost?
2 dollars with the discount offer, 4 dollars without. With global standard direct line shipping: 1.44 shipping. DHL is 16.76.

Most likely going to go with GSDL shipping. Not sure if discount will apply.

## Design
##### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional***
Used the tutorial. Did it a while ago. Wasn't sure about it, came back and finished it. Video was very helpful and essential. The original instructionable helped me understand the programming of it.
