# Eddie's cool tech PCB business card
<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is a cool business card with NFC. It has my name and contact info on it.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
On JLCPCB, it says it costs $2? But, idk if that's right.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
First, I was planning on creating a USB-C hub, but I didn't know how to start since I've never created a PCB before. So, I tried making something easier, wihch was this business card. Also, for the USBC hub, I tried asking my friend to help (he's insane at hardware), but he said he's never made something that complicated (lol)
