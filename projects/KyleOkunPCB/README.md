# KYLE OKUN LED CHASER

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I created a 555 LED Chaser. To add to the design, I chose to add a small table of common digital electronic components.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$63.03 (Not including shipping + taxes)
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
My biggest challenge was routing the PCB in the design process when the Auto-Router didn't want to work! Some trial and error led to the discovery of Via's, and from there I was able to complete the design with little trouble.
