# Sayhan Rahman's PCB Hacker Card
![Image of Card](https://github.com/sayhan1610/HackerCard/blob/main/projects/sayhan_rahman/card.gif?raw=true)

This is a simple PCB business card with NFC antenna in it. Follows Maggie's tutorial on Hack Club Jams but the design is almost completely my own.

Including shipping, it should cost a maximum of $25 from JLCPCB.

So, having never desinged PCBs much before, I definitely struggled with wiring the components. I had some experience with Hackpad but it definitely wasn't enough. But kind people exists in #electronics and they sure did help me out.
