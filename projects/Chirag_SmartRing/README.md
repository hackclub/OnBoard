<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am making a smart fitness ring that tracks your heart rate, fall detection and body temperature.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

$130(with assembly from JLCPCB)
$57(without assembly)
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->

I was thinking about some projects and then I got a view on Galaxy smart ring but the main fault is that it cannot be fixed if broken so I came with this idea that fix this fault.
