# hackercard by milan

Um i made a hacker card, that basically has my name, my social media handles and some cool plane art on it,im a big figter jet fan, so i put a picture of a Sukhoi 57 on it, which is pretty amazing to look at
and um, I looked at the hacker card tutorial made by maggie, which helped me build this, and shoutout to @and (#electronics on hack club slack) for helping me fix some issues with the board
and it costs like 82.31$ , overall i had a ton of fun making this. thanks
