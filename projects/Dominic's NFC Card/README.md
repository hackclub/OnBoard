# Dominic's NFC Card

## Summary

##### Yet another NFC Business Card from Maggie Liu's tutorial. I'll probably have it link to my website's contact page.

## Plan

Order 5 boards (or are they cards now) from JCLPCB, with parts comes out to just over $22 with a _"special offer_. Shipping is ~$15.

Then probably make another batch with a different design? Not sure on the rules for this.

## Design

Like I said, I followed the tutorial. Then played around with it for a while, getting the design better. It was really interesting to see more of how this stuff works, I usually stick to code.
