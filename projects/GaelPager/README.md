# GAEL PAGER

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This board is a prototype of restaurant pagers but for a different purpose. This pager is for reminders for events that require participants to show up to a queueing area, and it will be most effective in areas with low mobile connectivity.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It will cost $97.33 overall, $74.53 for the parts, and $22.80 for shipping.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
