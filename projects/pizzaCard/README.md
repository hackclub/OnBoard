# pizzaCard
I followed the PCB Hacker Card tutorial and made my own hacker card! It's not that complicated, but I think I did a good job, as this is my first attempt at making a PCB. It is going to cost $38.72. EasyEDA was pretty simple to use, and I think I could make my own PCB with a bit more practice.
