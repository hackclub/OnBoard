# Simple PCB Motor

This is a simple 20mm PCB motor generated using the Kimotor plugin. It's a 4 layer board and tries to fit as many turns of the coil as possible in this form factor. I'm using this with a breadboard for testing, nothing fancy yet. In a future verison, I will integrate the driver and batteries onto the PCB to make this my fidget spinner rotor.

I used fast DHL shipping so I can iterate on this design before school starts up again.
