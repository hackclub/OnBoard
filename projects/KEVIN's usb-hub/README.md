# KEVIN's usb-hub

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is a USB splitter. It has 1 USB-A port on one side and 3 (I added 1 as per the original tutorial) USB-A ports on the other side. It can transfer both power and data.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The tutorial has two ports, I changed the layout and added a port.
