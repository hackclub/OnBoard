# Charles' Cool Cards

This is meant to be a personal business card that I could carry and/or give to others. It's based on a tutorial to get into PCB making. When activated by an NFC compatible device, a LED will light up and a link will be sent (will need to be set up). 

$32.07

Designing graphics for it was very interesting for me personally, the tutorial was very helpful for me beginning.
