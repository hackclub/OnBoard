# Michaels PCB NFC CARD

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This board is a PCB NFC business card that displays my information and serves as a conversation starter.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$19.05

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The initial design was easy. The part I had the most trouble with was getting the 2-layer PCB to accommodate the last wire for the antenna.
