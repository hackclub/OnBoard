# NFCards
## Summary
##### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
NFCards are PCBs that are the same height and width as a credit card (ID-1 ISO standard). They can be used as unique paperless business cards that can be programmed to open a website when tapped by a phone or other NFC-reading device. 

## Plan
##### How much is it going to cost? What's your timeline?

The total cost is around 25 dollars per 5 PCBs, dependant on PCB color for each design, before shipping. I plan to test and use my projects as soon as possible, following their delivery.

## Design
##### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional**

This is my first time designing a PCB. Luckily, I found an NFC Business Card tutorial by a fellow Hack Clubber, Maggie, to be very helpful, inspiring, and educational. 

I initially began following her tutorial steps, though I ended up playing around a bit, tinkering with components such as using a different-colored LED for my Gaynor McCown Hack Club NFCard design, or even making artistic looks using copper wiring in addition to silkscreen. 

At first, I intended to have two antennas and two seperate chips, each triggering a different LED, on each card, but after asking around in the Slack, and using a credit card for size reference, I found it too complex to use properly considering the small size of the card (it's easy for more than one antenna might to be triggered at the same time, as they're close together on a tiny board).

Ultimately, I simplified my design down to one antenna, one chip, and one LED, but because of less wiring needed, I had more creative freedom to use copper aesthetically, as an extra appearance enhancement to complement silkscreen texts and shapes.

I've made two NFCard designs; one is a Personal Computer Scientist business card, and another commemorates the Hack Club I've founded, learned and developed (in many ways) through, Gaynor McCown Hack Club.

I found this to be an enjoyable learning experience that I will remember for years to come.
