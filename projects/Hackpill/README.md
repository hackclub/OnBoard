<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

Similar to an Arduino Nano but more powerful, has more pins and made by myself

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

Around $50 USD with 5 assembled boards. The price shown in the image will be lowered by $6 using a coupon

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->

This will be done in a future jam (jams.hackclub.com) and a workshop on Saturday the 5th
