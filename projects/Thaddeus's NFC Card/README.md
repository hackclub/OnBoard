# Thaddeus's NFC Card  
  
### Description  
It's a basic NFC card with my socials and website printed on it - that harvests energy to light up an LED. I'll try to write a vCard, such that anyone who scans the card will have my contact pop up.  
  
### Costs  
According to JLCPCB, $47.60 for 5 pieces.  
$29.84 for the PCBs and $17.76 for shipping.  
  
### Design Process  
I'm quite the perfectionist, so getting things **mostly** neatly aligned (down to 3 decimal places) was really a challenge. Especially because icons have different sizes, and the alignment is quite funky.  
Also, I've never designed a PCB before, so the wiring and things were a bit difficult to understand. Great experience once I got the hang of it, honestly, and the tutorial was really helpful too.
