Project: NFC business card
summary:
I created this card to exchange contact information when partnering with fellow club members or people. This is my first PCB project ever and I wanted a business card that didn't require lots of paper.

Plan: This project will cost 47.46$. My timeline is preferably 3-4 days of production time.
