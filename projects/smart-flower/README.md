# SMART FLOWER

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My board is an IoT device designed to be placed in a vase to remind me when to water my plant. It monitors the humidity and temperature and stores the data on a website and application that I am developing. The website will display watering status, temperature, humidity changes, and other relevant information. And I will design a 3d flower case for it to look nice :D

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The board itself costs $2, and the assembly costs $68.49.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
During the design process, I faced a significant setback when the power cut off, forcing me to start from the beginning. Additionally, one of the challenges was that the initial assembly cost was too high due to the use of external components. I spent considerable time searching for alternative basic components, which eventually helped reduce the assembly cost.
