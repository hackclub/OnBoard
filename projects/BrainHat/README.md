# Brain Hat

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
A custom EEG amplifier for use with an Arduino and a baseball hat I modified.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$78.07 without a discount, but I have a $9 discount so **$72.04**

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
