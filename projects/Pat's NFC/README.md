# Pat's NFC 

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
A simple light-up NFC Card with my contact info and a sick Pegasus logo on the side in gold. 
Once tapped to a phone or NFC reader, the LED will draw power and light up blue.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
According to jlcPCB, the board costs ~$3.00

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I had to move the parts on the PCB around a couple times due to wiring issues, and a lot of dimensions had to be exact.
