# Baseball LED chaser

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
baseball shaped PCD with red LEDs. Controlled by a 555 timer.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? --> $52.24

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** --> 
The shape is a circle and the LEDs are in the shape of the laces of a baseball and the LEDs are red to resemble the red laces. The color of the board is white to be the ball. Some challenges were having wires too close and blocking wires off from reaching where they need to go. The way I fixed it was using both sides of the board and adjusting the wires to make it so that they don't hit each other.
