# Perf Board

### Description
I was trying to come up with PCB ideas and perf board came to mind so I wipped up a version of this quickly in easyEDA and ordered from JLCPCB.

### Cost
It will cost $10.90 and was ordered with my pico backpack project from JLCPCB.

### Experience
Lesson Learned: Having a friend look at your project before you order it is very helpful.
