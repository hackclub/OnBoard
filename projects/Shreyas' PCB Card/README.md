# Shreyas' PCB Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I made a business card with a PCB. On the silkscreen layer, it has my containt information and socials. It also has NFC so it can tap to a phone and open my personal website while also flashing an LED.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$19.80.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I faced a challenge with manually routing some of the traces and fixing any short circuits I had.
