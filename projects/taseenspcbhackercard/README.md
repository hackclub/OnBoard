Taseen's hacker card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My board is a board that I'll flash the nfc card with my phone number. And if someone asks for my contacts, I can give them this to scan. It's a "tool" to share my contact information.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The JLCPCB manufacturer says the grand total is $12,27 where the Merchandise total $2,00 cost and that the shopping fees $7,72 and the customs duties & taxes $2.85 cost.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I first off begin with placing in the components, afterwards I converted the schematic design to a PCB, and I had to connect the copper lines so that that it is functional. And afterwards I exported it.
