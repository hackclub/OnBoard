# luteron6's Hack Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
It's an RFID buisness card. I haven't decided what it will do yet, perhaps be a key card in the future. It has an LED.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
JLCPCB is telling me it will cost $19.51 after tax, shipping, and coupons.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
This was my first time designing and ordering a PCB. I had a great time learning how to place components and route traces. The video on the tutorial above was very helpful.
