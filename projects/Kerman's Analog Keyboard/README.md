Kerman's Analog Keyboard

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is my analog keyboard pcb. It has a volume potentiometer, and is controlled by a blackpill board, I have added my own macro keys for custom functions. I will create my own firmware to implement snap tap functionality.


<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The pcb will cost ~100$ USD with assembly from JLCPCB with the minimum of 2 boards

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
