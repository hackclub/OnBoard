NFC Hacker Card:
1) This will be my business card that links to my chess profile. I always have trouble searching my profile whenever I go to a chess tournament, and it is
even worse when I try sharing it with friends. This card will use NFC to link my profile to make it accessible wherever I go. Additionally, it has a QR code to
my favorite chess website and my profile for new opponents to friend me!

2) The design costs about $12 before shipping
