<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
here's my hacky holidays submission, its a keychain about a burnt cookie with neopixels that represents radioactive chips. The neopixels will pulse and the colours will switch when the button is pressed.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
my project will cost $76.83 to order the pcb, but someone say the neopixel can be economic, so i think it will be around $50

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
