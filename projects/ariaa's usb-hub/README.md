# USB-HUB

I'm making a usb-hub, 4 in 1 adaptor, for USB type A.
It is going to cost 5.60$, plus the shipping fee which is about 23.91$, so 29.51$, but I also have a new customer coupon (-10$), so it's actually 19.51$. 
I started the design process using the tutorial and once I got the hang of EasyEDA I slowly
drifted away from the tutorial, without changing what I'm making. In the end I checked with the
tutorial to see if what I designed was correct.
