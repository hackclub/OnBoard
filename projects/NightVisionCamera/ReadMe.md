# Night Vision Trail Camera

I'm working with Thomas and Nila to make a night-vision trail camera.

It will show a preview of what the camera sees on an LCD screen, have a button to take a photo, and then capture the photo onto an SD Card. 

It's going to cost $86.77 for 5 boards. 

I'll have to buy the camera module separately because it's on LCSC but not on JLC for some reason. 

The process was wild. What really helped was reaching out to Charlie and getting help when needed.
