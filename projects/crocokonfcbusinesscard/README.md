Crocoko's NFC Business Card
I'm making a business card that links to my website, so when I'm about I can get others to view my website by using their phone to scan NFC. I will give some cards to my friends so that they can keep them and program them to their liking. I am also hoping to integraten some into my NFC based lock that I plan to build on my door.

It costs $51.26

I found it difficult to wire the parts correctly and ensure they're all correct. I got Google to help with this, along with someone in the Slack.
