# Adam's Hacker Card

This is an NFC hacker card that lets me store my website on its NFC chip. It also has a silkscreen with my name, contact information, and a QR code for people without NFC in their phone. Although I won't be giving it to people (too expensive) I will be using it to give my contact information to people.

The PCB itself costs $3.10 to manufacture, shipping is estimated at $1.50, and I used a coupon to waive the PCB manufacturing cost so the subtotal (excluding tax) is $1.50. After estimated tax, the cost becomes $1.64.

This was my first time creating a PCB. I used EasyEDA (the web version) to make my PCB as the tutorial suggested, and I found it much easier than expected. Routing the components was the hardest part, as I kept having to figure out how to make traces not overlap. The tutorial was really helpful in showing me how to route the components used and gave me lots of tips on avoiding overlaps. Overall, I learned a lot.
