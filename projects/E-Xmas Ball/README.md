# E-XMAS BALL
E-Xmas ball is a small, simple, electronic circuit designed by me to cheer up the holidays and bring technology and electronics to the Christmas tree.
It is composed of an attiny85 powered by 3V with 2 AAA batteries in series which is programmed to create light effects with two series of 6 LEDs in parallel
There is also a protection diode to avoid damage if the polarity of the batteries is reversed and a switch to turn the circuit on and off

# COSTS
the PCB costs $2 (for 5 pieces) while the assembly, necessary since there are some small smd pieces, costs $25.05
to this we add shipping which is $19.8 (since I live far from China :) )

# Design process, challenges & help that I recive.
It all started because I had the desire to learn how to design PCBs like some of my friends who go to electronics school already do; 
the path was not easy but thanks to the advice given by my friends and other advice given by a teacher at my school I got here.
