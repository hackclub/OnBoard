# mobile power station charger

Goal of this pcb is to charge and log data of charging and discharging connected battery modules.
This board contains 160W charger that will be able to charge our battery from USB C up to 100W or from DC barrel jack up to 160W which voltage from 9V to 60V.
There is also a ESP32 microcontroller that will connect to our phone to provide precise data about charging and discharging from all connectors.
It also has connectors for various modules that will provide power in different ways, such as standard and fast USB ports, ports with regulated voltage and more.

~~Cost of this board is 99.17$ for 5 pcb's, 2 assembled. I removed some easy to solder components to fit in 100$ grant.~~
~~But this is price in the cart, so with shipping and customs it will be more expensive (137.92$) so I will need to donate to onboard this additional 37.92$.~~
Cost of this board is 66.65$ for 5 pcb's, 2 assembled. I removed more components to fit with together with shipping and customs in 100$ grant.
So now final price is 97.52$.

Datasheets of various components is the best help in design process :)
