# Eddy's NFC Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I thought having a custom business card would be cool. I thought having a custom business card that taps onto people's phones and pull up my website would be even cooler. I thought that getting it for free with OnBoard would be even cooler than that. So I decided to put together a PCB NFC card with EasyEDA and JLCPCB. I followed the jam, and after a few hours of work, I was able to design a card I was happy with. It has my information and website, and a QR code on the back.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The total cost is around $45, half of which is the shipping.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I used Google Drawings to design the image I overlaid onto the silkscreen, and it worked really well. I found an astronomy image sheet and layered it onto the back, and added a QR code. I found it difficult to work with JLCPCB. Specifically, one of the parts in the jam was out of stock, so I had to go consult the Slack channel to see if anyone else had the same problem. Fortunately, someone did, and there was a solution already posted (a replacement part).
