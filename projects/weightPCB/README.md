# Weight PCB 

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My PCB contains a load cell and hx711 amplifier along with other componments to monitor the weight above 
when powered on. The readings are then sent to the microcontroller to be processed and depending on the 
weight changes, the LED strip will illuminate red. 

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$2 (according to JLCPCB)

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I went through multiple drafts to finalize my design process and as this was the first time I designed a 
PCB it was a struggle to learn the different symbols and calculate current charges.
