# Buzz 'n Scare em'

## Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?

I am making a PCB for TrickorTrace and therefore this is a halloween themed PCB. It has a motion sensor (JLCPCB Part: EKMB4308112K) but unfortunately that part is in a time of scarcity so I opted for another part that is in stock (it also didn't let me go through the trasnsaction if I didn't pick another part).  
</br></br>
Now about the project. It is suppsoed to have a motion sensor for one eye and that will detect for motion. When motion is detected, it will buzz and scare the activator.
</br></br>
## How much is it going to cost? 
As shown in cart.png, it will cost aroung $80.
