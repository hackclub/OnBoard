# Arash's USB Hub

It is a 4 port USB Hub that I will be making for my desktop setup

The parts are really cheap even though i selected quality parts from jlcpcb.com/parts website. It is just under 65$ with assembly also.

I had a hard time finding the IC for the USB hub at first because i thought making a USB hub would be as easy as plugging many female usb ports to one usb connection of the computer, which is not the case. A little research on USB hubs helped me pick out the right chip for it.
