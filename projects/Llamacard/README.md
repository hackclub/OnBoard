##### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
> My board is a extremely overlycomplicated NFC Businesscard with my username and GitHub handle on it. It will be able to be scanned by a phone and will open a link to my own website or maybe something else I want to put on there.

<br>

##### How much is it going to cost?
> The order total on JLCPCB came out to just under $100 at 97.93 USD for 5 pcs. This includes shipping and "Customs duties & taxes". See cart.png for more details.

<br>

##### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped?
> I would love to! 
> 
> I firstly began with thinking out how i would like to make it in my head. I then opened Figma for the first time in ages and got to work. Things quickly got out of hand and I ended up with a very complicated design. I then had to simplify it a bit to make it more manufacturable. 
> 
> Due to the incredibly bad way of importing SVGs into EAsyEDA, i have now probably spend over 4 hours in Illustrator, Photoshop, Figma and Inkscape just remaking SVG's and making them the perfect size! Then it was time to import everything into EasyPDA. After sitting and moving things around in EasyPDA for ages, This is the final result! 
> 
> I then exported the gerber files and uploaded them to JLCPCB. I then ordered the boards and waited for them to arrive. I then soldered the components on and programmed the board. I then tested it and it worked! I then wrote this README.
>
> I am extremely thankful for everyone in the Slack and the awesome tutorial by Maggie. I would not have been able to do this without them!
>
> That was all, Llama out!
