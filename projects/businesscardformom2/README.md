business card for mom 2

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am making a business card for my mom, to help support her artist career. It will serve as a great way to have people pull up her IG right away, 
by scanning the QR code, and seeing her other socials right away as well. I also had her signature, and an outline of one of her paintings imprinted
on the card, so that was a really cool aspect of creating this!
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$37.65 total
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
