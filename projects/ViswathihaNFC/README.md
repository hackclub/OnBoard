<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is a project I made for a stem club workshop. It is a PCB that lights up and sends a link. 
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$31.48
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
We all worked on it together on EasyEDA with the stem president running the workshop. Some of the challenges were stopping because other people were falling behind, or everyone moving on while I still needed help.
