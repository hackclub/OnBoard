# Eesa's Hacker Card

Hello! My name is Eesa Zahed and this is my time working on a PCB. I built a hacker board that contains an NFC tag, LED, and a QR code.


Merchandise Total: $19.72

Shipping Charge: $17.80

Order Total: $37.52


I found the tutorial a little confusing at times and I had to ask some questions in the #electronics channel along the way. However, making the board  was fun.
