# Jenny Li 555 LED Chaser
# We are making a 555 timer with 10 LEDs to represent a LED chaser circuit. In addition, there is a potentiometer on the board to control the resistance of the circuit.

# This will cost around $28 dollars. I have finished designing and uploaded the board to JLCPCB to be manufactured, and expect it to arrive by next week.
