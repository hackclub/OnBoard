Flipper Zero addon board 
<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

This is a expansion board, for the multitool Flipper Zero. It adds functions like a 443mhz radio, a GPS and a ESP-32.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

Around 65 dollars, I will order 5 of them along with PCBA.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? Totally optional -->

I originally created a simple business card, because i did not know how to design more complicated stuff, but a friend helped me out. Shout out to Jason!
