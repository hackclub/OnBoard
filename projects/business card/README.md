# Business Card 

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I made a PCH business card that I want to test out. I can give these to my friends and it has a QR code to my profile.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$33.59 dollars ( I originally said it was 16 dollars; that's my bad)
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
There weren't much difficulties as the tutorials that I were given were helpful, the only difficulties were learning how to use a new program.
