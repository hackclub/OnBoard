DC-DC_Transformer

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I made a dc to dc transformer that takes 12v dc input and provide 3x 12v , 5v and 3v each dc output , i am making this to use it as a powerhouse for my projects as i make some very frequently !!...

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It will be abt 67$ along with the shipping charges ! It's a lil high for this because i added some designs on it making it a little big ...
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
It was a little difficult for me as I am just new to all this but had a very little knowledge which helped me out
