# KrishveerCard

It is a business card made out of a printed circuit board that has ESP32 built in which stores website data.

It is on the expensive side because it has esp32 built in which are not very cheap. But I tried my best to keep it less $90

This is my first time making a 4 layer PCB, so it was a bit challenging for me. i little help from the kicad documetation and forums helped me finally produce it.

#The design is open source so anyone can download the files and make their own :)
