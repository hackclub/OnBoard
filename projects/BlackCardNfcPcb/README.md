# BlackCardNFCPcb

I made Maggie Liu's design for a buisness card nfc pcb.  I decided to leave it completely bland so I could repuprose it for diferent thigns later on.  I did it because everyone needs to start somewhere and why not with tutorials that will end up getting me the physical product.

The cost is $40.51

I had problems tryign to get jlcpcb to accept my bom file and it took a little while besides that no problems
