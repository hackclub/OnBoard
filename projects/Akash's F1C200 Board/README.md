# All Winner F1C200 Board

I have designed a board around the new All Winner F1C200 which is capable of running python and can expand to other applications very seamlessly as it easily configurable with an UNIX os embedded in it.

It costs 91$ for me since I have coupon. If you dont have a coupon it can cost you just right over a hundred dollars for 5 of them all assembled.

This is very small size pcb having its dimensions similar to a Raspberry Pi Zero W and it is designed with only two layers. The top layer has most of the connections and the bottom layer was used to route the vias.
