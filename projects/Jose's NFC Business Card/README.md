# Project Name
Jose's NFC Business Card

## Summary
I made an NFC business card with the PCB Hacker Card tutorial.

##### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
With the PCB Hacker Card tutorial, I made an NFC business card which contains my information as a regular business card. But, if you tap it, it will link to my personal website.

## Plan
I designed the card and it is ready for purchasing.

##### How much is it going to cost?
It costs $11.50 for 5 cards, plus $1.50 for shipping.

## Design
See Uploaded Files

##### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional***
I was first going to make it a double sided card with one side being a business card, and the other being a school card, but it would be a bit difficult because I would have to order it as PCBA and since I barely know nothing about PCBs, I don't want to mess it up. I also didn't know what to put for design so I had my basic information and logos of past/current companies.
