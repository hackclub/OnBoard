# Simon's Business Card

## Basically I made a NFC compatiable business card that I can tap and give people my info. It also lists things like my name website and other info like handles!

### Its going to cost about $17.50 USD

### The biggest challenge I had was making sure that I was designing it so there was no short-circuit!
