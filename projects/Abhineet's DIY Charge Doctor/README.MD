# Abhineet's USB Charge Doctor

It works similar to a Charge Doctor which can take a note of the amperage and the voltage being supplied to the electronics. The brain behind this is the ATTINY85 Microcontroller which will be programmed by an Arduino. It will also have an OLED display and 2 charging indicators which will let the user know when the charging is done.

It costs $77.54 in which 5 boards will be assembled and shipped to me. Stuff like OLED and a few Type-C ports will be soldered once I receive the boards here so it will add up.

I built this board in sort of 2 way, which basically means that the board needs to be assembled from both the sides. The top and the bottom, it was quite tedious to trace the board. Phil's Design which is a youtube channel helped me alot into understanding how to trace the boards. At the end, it was quite an interesting design.
