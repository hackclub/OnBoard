# YOUR PROJECT NAME

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This board is a small little heart that you can make in order to give to a special someone! In fact, it features an NFC chip (using a tutorial to guide me through the design process) that can send the person to a website I am currently developing. Furthermore, if said person is unable to scan with their device, a QR code is available!!!

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
In total, this should cost 64.67$ or around 13$ per board.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
