# Water Bottle Keychain for The Trail

## Summary

##### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?

Not sure if I'm going on The Trail but I used this as an excuse to learn how to build a PCB and get Thomas' help doing so. Basically, it's a keychain with a bunch of neopixels / LEDs. The LEDs are a countdown timer that reminds you to drink water. After 20 minutes has passed, it'll start flashing red. Before the 20 minutes, it acts like a progress bar. It's a keychain you can attach to your pack so others can remind you to drink up.

## Plan

##### How much is it going to cost? What's your timeline?

I might of gotten this wrong but looks like it's going to be $15:

## Design

##### Tell us a little bit about your design philosophy. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional**

So, funny story. Thomas, Dieter and I went on an overnight hike up Mt. Mansfield (staying at Butler Lodge) and... when we got to the top, realised that we didn't have water. Shucks. Our plan was to work on projects whilst we were up that and I'd been wanting to actually finally figure out how to make a PCB so I designed this PCB on top of that mountain with Thomas' help. Yeah, I know it's basic but it was pretty cool to finally figure out how to do this. A kind man taught us how to filter water from the stream.

Process-wise, I made a basic version in Wowki and then used EasyEDA. ðŸ¤ž I didn't screw up too bad.
