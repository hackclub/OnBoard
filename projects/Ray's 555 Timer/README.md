# Ray's 555 Timer

My PCB board is a physical implementation of a project I worked on in class. The project is called "555 timer", and will serve as the main clock for future projects. It does this by emitting an electrical signal at a specified frequency and lighting up LEDS.<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

According to EasyEDA, my board will cost $27.82<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

The circuit design was the easiest part, as I had built 555 timers multiple times to use for many, if not all of my in-class projects. The hardest part for me was implementing the circuit design into a PCB board as I actually had to think and plan out the physical locations of each component and their wires instead of placing them wherever was conveinent. The guest speakers that visted my class helped as they had a lot of useful tips and tricks that saved me a TON of time, as well as guiding me through an unfamiliar and somewhat confusing software.<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
