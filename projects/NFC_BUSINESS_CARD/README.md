# NFC Business Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I made a business card with a NFC chip which will direct someone to a certain website upon contact with the chip. 
When it works successfully, the led on the board will light up and it will also contain a QR code.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It will cost around $19 for production and the shipping will be $11 more which includes taxes.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The design process was relatively simple as I mostly followed the tutorials. Some challenges I found were the routing errors which I had to fix by adjusting the width of the wires.
It was also hard to understand the concept of layers until I watched another follow up video which really aided in the learning experience overall.
