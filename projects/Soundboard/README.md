# Soundboard
## Summary
##### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
I am making a soundboard in a macropad style. There will be two rows of 5 switches with keycaps, making a total of 10 buttons. 
Pressing each button will make a different sound effect. (VINE BOOM)

## Plan
##### How much is it going to cost?
Using OnBoard, the PCB should be of no cost. However, I am spending around $40 on other parts, such as the Adafruit board, speaker, keycaps, and battery pack. 

## Design
##### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional***
I've been talking forever to everyone about how I want to make a soundboard for the past 3 months. Thankfully, now it's a reality!!
The design started off with a very messy sketch on Procreate. From there, I worked to make the PCB with the help of a more experienced friend. 
The biggest challengewas having to learn KiCad, which was a new experience for me.
