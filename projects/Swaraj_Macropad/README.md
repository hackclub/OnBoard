# YOUR PROJECT NAME

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I've made a macropad with 9 switches in total, in a 3x3 matrix. I also have a OLED Display and Rotary encoder that I will solder myself. The macropad is based around the raspberry pi pico, and I had a few laying around which is why I decided to use it. I just wanted to try making my own pcb as I was curious and missed out on hackpad ysws :(.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Without factoring in costs for the OLED, rotary encoder, diodes, and raspberry pi pico, $2.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Initially I had no clue how to lay out my macropad and messed up a few times. I realised if I put the raspberry pi pico all the way at the back it would be hard to power it as the other components would block the port. also I put the switches too close to each other so had to fix that too. I still don't know if this will work or not lol.
