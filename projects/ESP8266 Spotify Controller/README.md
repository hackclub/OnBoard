# Spotify Controller

It is ESP8266 based board which will allow user to control their spotify. It can be used as nice desk item. 

## Cost
According to JLCPCB , 2$ is for PCB, 40.20$ for Assembly, 21.80$ for shipping, 5$ for display(JLCPCB doesnt have SSD1306 Display so its not included in assembly, i just left a female header for plug and play). But it can build under 15-20$ if we do all by ourself.

## The Hard Part
One of the hardest part was memory management, ESP8266 comes with very limited amount of memory and to run the display and parsing the API requests, after that PCB design was little complicated as its my first time doing it, the tutorial really helped.
