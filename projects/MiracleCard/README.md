# MiracleCard

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
Miracle card is my personal hacker card, and I decided to go all out on the design. I'm using a qtpy from adafruit as the brain on the back, since it not only is tiny and cute, but it also has 5 captouch pins, and it can use an oled display. I have three captouch pads, so I can use the card as a macro pad, and I have a couple of LEDs to use as a dimmable reading light. Basically, I just wanted an electronic multitool with my name on it :P 
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
it is going to cost $63.73 USD.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
This was really fun to design! this is the first ever pcb I have designed, so it was interesting figuring out how the software worked and getting some best practice tips from my dad, who is an electrical engineer and does this kind of thing basically daily.
