# DynamicWhiteHat's NFC Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My board is a recreation of the NFC card tutorial by Maggie. It has a QR code to my Github website, and my handle. The NFC will have a URL to a website or it might be used for other features, such as wifi.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The prototype costs $2.00 and the economic PCBA costs $14.19. With the cheapest shipping, this brings the total price to ***$27.54***

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
One challenge I faced was when trying to figure out how Maggie was able to get a via, as I had never made a PCB before and didn't have that done for me with the auto routing. I also had trouble getting my images on as one piece, but I found ways to fix them both.

~Thanks HackClub!
