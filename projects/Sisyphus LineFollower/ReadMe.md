# Sisyphus. The Line Follower

Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
<br><br>
It's a all in one high-speed line follower robot powered by the STM32F103 microcontroller and Pololu N20 10:1 high-speed micrometal gear motors. It utilizes 12 IR sensors for precise line detection. The PCB includes built-in 1.8A motor drivers for controlling two high-speed motors, an OLED display, and a header for a Bluetooth receiver module, which must be connected separately. Additionally, four 6x6 tactile buttons allow for manual operation during testing and debugging. An IR decoder receiver is also integrated for remote control functionality.
<br><br>
 How much is it going to cost?
<br><br>
Though The cart says it'll be around 99 dollars it'll be more for me since I have to pay customs which will be.
<br><br>
Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional***
<br><br>
Mostly there werent many difficulties. Other than keeping the price in check & find parts in check it was just really really tedious. Not hard. Not difficult. Just tedious. Just one by one hoping that the drc doesnt scream in my face. A trick I used to get through that is to leave some little easter eggs thoughout the pcb. That way you'll be more excited for the end goal.
