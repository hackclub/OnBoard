# HeatingBedPCB

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is a heated bed pcb that i designed with onboard live with the purpose of using in in my 3d printer that i am designing with #infill.
its pretty simple, its just a very long line of zigzags about 12 metters and on the back it has pads so that i can solder a thermistor to it
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
44.02 so about 45 dollars

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
it took some research because i wasnt sure how to get the thickness of the traces right and i didnt know how spaced they should be
