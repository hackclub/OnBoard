OptiScan-X-PCB-Project:  
Summary: A small PCB that is capable of connecting to a cellular device and can scan and run an AI analysis tool. I want to use oppertunity to study how AI works, and how it percieves the world around us, and also learn how to design and build PCB's for future projects.
  
Plan: This is going to cost anywhere from $35 - $85 depending on if I want it pre-assembled. I have been working on this since the 2nd of February and want to have this done ASAP.
  
Design: Some challenges I faced along the way were mainly learning how to design a PCB because this was the first I ever designed. Another challening quandary I faced was trying to get this to the least amount of layers as possible due to costs of like 10 layer PCB's. It helped by watching some tutorials online and asking AI such as ChatGPT and Deepseek for tips.
