# Blaze's USB-C Hub

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

This board is a simple USB C to 4 USB A hubs. My laptop only has 2 USB A ports so this will help me connect more devices to it.

it's an easy way to allow your single usb c connection into a more versatile 4 USB A connectors. This will work with direct USB C to C or USB A to C. Only 5v is supported.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
C$90.50
(For a breakdown, check out cost.png)
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Some challenges I faced were properly laying them out to get it as small as possible for ease of use. Looking at other commerial dongles helped me figure out a good placement.
