# YOUR PROJECT NAME

My board is a business card-format PCB with an NFC chip and coil. I saw the tutorail and thought "this looks really cool" and so I made it. 

$21.97 CAD

The design process was unique. I had never proplerly designed a PCB before and honestly the process was very enjoyable.
the hurdles came when JLC decided to bug out and I could not take the requred scrrenshot for OnBoard for ~3 hrs. Despite many attempts. 
Finally I got it, and wishing for approval!
