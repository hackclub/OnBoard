# Noahs Board

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My first ever PCB designed ;D
A basic Hacker Card with an LED activated by NFC.
Basic info about me, an Functioning LED and a QR Code :)

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

45.12â‚¬ including shipping tax and customs (5 PCS)

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->

I've used easyeda.com. It is pretty hard at first but easy to understand the longer you work with it.
In total it took me around 2 Hours to make and finalize the PCB. And im very happy i've learned how to use PCB Design Software!
