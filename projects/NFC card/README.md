# YOUR PROJECT NAME
A business card that serves as an NFC
<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
The board is a pcb business card that also serves as a PCB. It has some basic information and branding on it, but when you scan it with your phone, it connects you to the wifi (I can also change this later)
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
42.27$
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
