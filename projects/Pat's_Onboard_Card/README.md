# Pat's Onboard Card

# Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
It's a card that lights up when its close to a phone. It has my emails and my github
printed on it too! Its black and the text is white because i like the contrast.

# How much is it going to cost?
16.50 us bucks without shipping. I can't choose the shipping without entering a credit card which I dont have.
but in the first section there was this 2.50 dollar option and it arrived in 8-12 days so in total without taxes
it should be something like 19 dollars.

# Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional***
This was my first time making a pcb and it was really cool! I dont think i would have ever made one if it werent for
Onboard. I did struggle a bit once in a while like when i couldnt find the right led but i got help from the people in
the Onboard channel! Thanks to them I managed to get everything to work without breaking my head open on my desk.
