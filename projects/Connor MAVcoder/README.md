## YOUR PROJECT NAME
4272MAVcoder
## Summarries
#### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? 
This is the 4th iteration of a magnetic encoder that I have been designing with my FRC team for the past year along
with some other boards. This board will be able to read the direction that a magnet is pointing, and the team will
mostly use it on our swerve modules (think motorized shopping cart wheels) so that the robot knows whish way it is 
facing.
#### How much is it going to cost?
The boards that are needed will cost around $40.
#### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? 
This is the 2nd board that I had designed and this board is nothing short of complex. When doing this one, I learned
lots of new ways to both use different parts, and CAD more efficiently. This board is designed to take place of an 
encoder that is for sale by another company, but it costed too much and had a lot more than we needed. During the first
iterations it was made to fit in the same casing as the company's encoder, but over time I grew it to mount in better
places. I also added some debugging points so that the team can make sure that the board is fuctioning, and they can fine
tune it when needed.
