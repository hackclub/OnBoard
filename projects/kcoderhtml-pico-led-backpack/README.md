# Pico LED Backpack
### Description
I had prototyped a led daughter board for my sprig pico with a breadboard and ended up really liking how it looked so I created this to simplify the wiring.

### Cost
It will cost $3.10 and was ordered with my perf board project costing in total $26.82.

### Experience
Having made 3 PCBs at this point and manufactured 2 it was much easier to use EasyEDA and I was able to create the board in around 30 minutes including 3 interations.
