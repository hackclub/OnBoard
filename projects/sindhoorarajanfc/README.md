# Sindhoora's NFC Card

This is a custom business card which has an RFID reader that can transmit a URL on tap and light up.

The cost of manufacturing the pcb is $17.98 and the shipping charge is $36.92 totalling to $54.90.

The tutorial was immensely helpful and extremely easy to follow and one issue was that it was rather hard to design a pcb without a mouse and I had to solely rely on my laptop's trackpad.
