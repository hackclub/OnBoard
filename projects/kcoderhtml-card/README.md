# Personal NFC Card and PCB Ruler

### Description
I followed maggie's tutorial and customized my own board.

### Cost
It will cost $58.35 with a $10 coupon from JLCPCB.

### Experience
The hardest part was settling on a design I liked and then trying to figure out the difference between ENIG layer heights (still haven't figured them out) and surface finish options. Maggie did a great job with the tutorial and as a beginner I found it very easy to follow.
