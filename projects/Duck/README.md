# Duck

Duck is a flight computer intended to be used in a thrust vector control rocket. Duck contains a stm32 microcontroller, a 6 axis IMU (accelerometer + gyro), a barometer, a GPS, a LoRA Module, 4 Pyro Channels, 4 Servo PWM Channels, and one last PWM channel for controlling a reaction wheel. 

The total cost of Duck (PCB + Components + Assembly) will cost upwards of $225, however, the PCB alone will cost $75 and I will cover the rest of the cost for components and assembly.

The designing process for this PCB took nearly 4 months. Many things had to be considered in the design, especially since we have an RF module and an inductor on the board. Throughout the design process of this board I learned a lot about controlled impedance, inductance, return currents, and more in PCB design, all of which I never had to consider when I had designed on breadboard.
