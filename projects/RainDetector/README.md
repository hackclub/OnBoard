# Rain Detector

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My board will detect rain when it falls on a capactive surface. When a rain droplet is detected, the board will light and LED and sound the buzzer to notify users of rain. This board is meant to be placed near more valuable electronics so that excessive condensation/rain can be detected before it causes too much damage.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It will cost $32.84 for 5 PCBs from JLCPCB. This cost does not include shipping. 
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
When I was creating this PCB, I spent a lot of time learning the basics of electronics. I was a complete beginner when I started, but this process has let me learn the fundamentals of circuit/PCB design.
