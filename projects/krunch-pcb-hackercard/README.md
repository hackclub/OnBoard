# krunch's PCB hacker card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is my PCB hacker card, it has my website and GitHub url on the front, a LED, and a NFC chip and coil. On the backside, there is a ruler and a chart of trace size and smd components size.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
This is going to cost about $47 for the PCB and PCB assembly
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I used the tutorial for the hacker card
