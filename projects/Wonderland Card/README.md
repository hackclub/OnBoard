# Lost in Wonderland
## Summary
##### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
Inspired by the upcoming(at time of upload) Hackathon [Wonderland](https://wonderland.hackclub.com/), this card was built with great help from the gracious maggie-j-liu who organized a wonderful and thorough PCB jam. 
These cards emit NFC signals and when completing the circuit emit and led signal. I hope to eventually redesign this card with further social information and/or a website to broaden the contacts.  

## Plan
##### Associated Costs
The PCB costs total to $43.90 with shipping taking up $17.80 and merchandise costs dictating $22.33.
