RudraCard

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I made a creative card that will be able to showcase myself to others I meet. It will also serve to showcase my work across all platforms I provide.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$39.07 according to the jlcpcb website checkout.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
My designing process was guided a lot by my club's president and supported by tutorial videos. The most challenging part was learning how to export and submit the project. The step by step guides and videos helped me get through this tough spot.
