# Ye's HackerCard

Made my very own PCB Hacker Card, my 1st ever PCB Project! A business card that can transmit a URL and light up when tapped, with unique styling

I believe it costs $2.00 according to the website, with the shipping cost it's subtotal was $26.55

I followed schematic, converted it to a PCB design and got scare from all the errors from antenna (people are telling me it fine so let hope it works) so I didn't try to add more LEDs. Placed components, and customized the card with cool image. The tutorial by Hackclub really me create my first PCB. Thank you so much, I really had a lot of fun playing with the different layers to create a cool visual affect!
