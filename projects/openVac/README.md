Until now the project has cost 17€ without including tools and common parts (resistors and capacitors).

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? -->
The design process was "Just do it." until after 13 session and many more hours I decided to restrucutre for the sake of planning and increasing my overall productivity.
I have now structured the process into Phases. Each phase focusing on one specific aspect of the final product.
