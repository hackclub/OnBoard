# My USB-A HUB created by using PCB Design

SO the objective of this Hub is so that in laptops/computers when there arent multiple USB-A type ports available to use, a USB Hub helps a lot by using one input into the laptop
but connects multiple devices at once. My USB HUB can connect 2 devices simultaneously into a single socket present in the laptop. This would help me in my organization. :)



The price for this is shown in the screenshot below -->

I created it mainly  by using the tutorial i specified above. It was very informative and had the perfect amount of information available for me to be able to design and build my own USB Hub. Extremely Grateful to HackClub for organizing such events and for all the help they're extending to us teenagers. Thanks a lot!! :))
