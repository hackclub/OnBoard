This is a PCB for a stenography keyboard (28 keys, using Lapwing theory)! It's powered by a Raspberry pi pico W and will run QMK firmware :3
It costs $53.43 (2x back side manufactoring. JLPCB does not have kailh choc v1 switches :(

Learning kicad was really hard, especially footprints. I think I'm comfortable using kicad now :D
