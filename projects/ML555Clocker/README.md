#ML555Clocker

There is a 555 component that I made a clock signal out of. The clock outputs for my use later, and also creates an LED chaser. The clock frequency varies due to a potentiometer.

It will cost $29.02. I'd want it back in 4-5 days.

The hardest part was finding correct components from libruary and using them right. Routing was easy and fun.
