# Hackmouse

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

The project is a pcb for a mouse that uses the PMW3360 sensor from pixart and a Xiao microcontroller from Seeed studio. 
I made it so that i can possibly make a YSWS for the project is the future. Its going to be a wired mouse for now but I could slso solder on some batteries to make it wireless. 
The sensor has up to 1600 dpi and is a very high end sensor overall while the buttons are pretty average micro switches.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$4 (I already have the parts because I stole them from scrapyard lol, I just need a pcb)

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I spent a lot of time trying to find a sensor that was high end but also was relitivly simple to implement. This one isn't quite as easy as just connectinf power and data but it was pretty close. Overall, making the board was pretty simple.
