# Greedy Potamus Podcast Card

I am making a promotional card for my podcast called the Greedy Potamus Podcast. It has a qr code and a nfc tag so it will open up the podcast when near a device.

It is going to cost $30.68.

I was completly new to this so it was a bit challenging. The hardest part was connecting all the things together and making sure there were no short circuits.
