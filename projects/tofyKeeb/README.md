# YOUR PROJECT NAME

I followed a tutorial on how to make a keyboard. I got interested in PCB design after my school handed out a flyer with this grant on that piece of paper. Then I spent several hours on research to create this keyboard.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

$104.23

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->

I didn't know how to use a MCU. I only have prior experience using Arduino so making this keyboard was completely new to me.
