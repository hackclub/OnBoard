# USB DAC

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This project uses the TI PCM2912A ic to act as a USB DAC that has a headphone jack output. It can output sound from the computer to a headphone jack. It should sound better than the onboard motherboard sound quality due to the use of high quality IC, capacitors, and power supply filtering. It has 16-bit 44.1KHz max audio quality, so nothing special, but I plan to use the experience I gained making this project to make further higher quality DACs.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
For 3 boards from OSHpark it will cost $24.90 USD Dollars.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The main challenge was figuring out how to calculate a crystal load capacitance which I had never done before, but it is not that hard, so I was able to figure it out.
