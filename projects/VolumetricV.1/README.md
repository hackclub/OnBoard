# Volumetric V.1

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? --> 
This board has an esp32s3 which drives a small transparent oled display and motor. After assembly it should be a working volumetric display.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
64.88 + 25.5 (shipping) = $90.38
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Designing this PCB took many iterations of changing parts, adding new functionality, and learning more on the way. I considered using the esp32s3 dev board, but it ended up being too big. Eventually I did settle on a design that should work.
