<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This board houses an atmega328 microcontroller. It will be used to control a neopixel strip.
The strip will rotate to trick your eyes into seeing a spherical display through the persistence of vision effect.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The fully assembled pcbs will cost a total of $50.73.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Designing this project required me to learn a bunch of new skills including soldering and pcb design.
