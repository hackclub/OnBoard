# Affordable Quality Slime Project

I am making a SlimeVR FBT tracker that is BMI270 based. It is ment to be a normal tracker, but be much more affordable then the normal tracker.

 $24.21 for the PCB & PCBA, excluding battery check resistor and the power switch, as those are not needed to test the functionality of the board. Also, the TP4056 and WeMos D1 mini will cost about $1.05 on AliExpress.
