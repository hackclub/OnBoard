# FlipperX

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
-DESC-
FlipperX is an expansion board for the popular multitool Flipper Zero. This board uses the GPIO ports to connect to the Flipper. It has GPS, ESP32, LEDS, external CC1101 module, and
breakout pins so it can be expanded in the future.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
-COST-
Manufacturing 5 PCBs with the first-time deal on JLCPCB costs $2.43.
The assembly of 2 PCBs costs $43.96.
NOTE: The female header pins on the top and bottom, the male pins, the Neopixel led, the esp32 xiao module, and the Ebyte cc1101 module are bought separately.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? -->
-STORY-
All the other GPIO expansion boards on the market were super expensive, had limited functionality compared to mine, and were big and bulky.
That's why I decided to take on the challenge of designing my board that fit into the footprint of a Flipper (20mmx100mm). The real challenge was routing all the traces,
there were so many of them and the board was tiny.
