# nfc-card

I first found about about his HackClub from a github email and shared with my schools hack club. I am making an nfc business card which I am linking to a website which can display som of my pictures. I am an amature photographer and and to start a side business so this is really helpful. The overall cost is around $20 for 5 cards.
