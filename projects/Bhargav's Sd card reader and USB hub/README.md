# USB hub & SD card reader

I have built a small 2.0 USB hub which has a built in SD card reader as well to easily burn images to Every Raspberry pi sd card out there

5 such boards cost around 82$ which means around $16.4 a board which is super cheap.

This board was designed in EasyEDA and I faced difficulty in routing the components. But nonetheless, youtube helped me a little bit to understand how to create traces.
