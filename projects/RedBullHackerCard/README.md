# Red Bull Hacker Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My board was made using the Hacker Card Jam and features a lot of F1 and Red Bull Racing images as I am a big fan! The board has my email and name on it and a NFC module that can be read by a device and potentially link to my personal website or github.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$12.74 for the manufacture of the boards and a steep $9.50 for the shipping even with the cheapest option of global direct. Crazy.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The hardest part for me was learning Easy EDA and spending ages trying to figure out how to write on the back of the board when it was as simple as changing layers. Another problem I had was routing the wires but I solved that one rather quickly :)!
