# FletchVR-V2

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
FletchVR is a carrier board for a BMI160 Gyroscope, TP4056, and a Wemos D1 Mini running SlimeVR firmware
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$40.60 dollars all in
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
This project is a seccond revision of my original submission as a result of it not fully working correctly, so the schematic has been altered to be neater. I purchased the board using leftover grant money without realising, and so this submission is a retroactive one, and I apologize for this.
