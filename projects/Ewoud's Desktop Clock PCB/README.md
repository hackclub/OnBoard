# Desktop Clock

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My board uses four 8 segment displays for 24-hour time with a real time module to keep time. I use shift regsters to convert serial signals coming from an 
arduino nano to parallel for the displays. I also have a switch to let the arduino know if daylight savings time is active.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$9.35 including shipping and tax

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
This was my first PCB that I designed and I used Kicad to design it. Digikey's kicad tutorial series helped me understand how Kicad worked.
