# USB A to C Hub

I felt more comfortable with PCB making, so I decided to tackle the USB hub which had a tutorial and had an avenue of creativity (USB C), plus I needed it. There's 3 USB A ports that go into one USB C port.

$49.76, but there are coupons.

I followed the tutorial, looked around for USB C documentation, built it, but then there was the trouble of getting standard or economic PCBA, also tracing but it's something that someone could tackle with resources in Slack and online.
