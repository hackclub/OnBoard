# PROJECT NAME
## Summary
This project is yet another NFC card! It has my personal information, for anyone to contact me, and a QR vCard Code for anyone whose device doesn't support NFC!

## Plan
According to JLCPCB, the calculated price for the PCB is $4 + $19.80 for shipping to Greece. 

## Design
The design process was simple! I followed the Jam's instructions to create my awesome card! I then began experimenting with images and adding icons.
