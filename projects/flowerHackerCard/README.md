# FLOWER HACKER CARD!

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
Modification on the hacker card jam for a cute flower keychain functional card.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$36.75

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Very easy following the tutorial and doing the schematic. Real trouble was up while trying to be creative and use all the different tricks for nice finishes but that still don't interefere with the parts. So had to redesign several times. Perseverance helped.
