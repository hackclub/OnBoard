# Circuit Sax

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
### Description
This will be the body of a saxophone MIDI controller. You would hook it up to a computer or phone and use it to play any software instrument you want using saxophone fingerings. It will have breath input and mechanical key switches with custom keycaps meant to mimic the feel of a saxophone. An Arduino Micro mounted to the board will be used for the computing and MIDI output. 

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
### Cost
It will cost around $35 including shipping. This doesn't include the other components that make up this project.

### Design
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
As I was coming up with ideas for how to make my device, I found [this project](https://github.com/cardonabits/haxo-hw/tree/main) which gave me a lot of inspiration for what it would look like. The hardest part was figuring out how to position the keys so that it would feel like a saxophone since the keys stick out at various angles. I ended up 3D modeling the entire thing based on measurements I took from my soprano sax, which included 5 total pieces connected together at bent angles, before finally mapping it onto a board in KiCad.
