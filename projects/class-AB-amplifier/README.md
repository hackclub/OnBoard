# YOUR PROJECT NAME

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This board is a Class AB amplifier based on the tda7297 chip. It should be able to drive small speakers adequately and with high quality sound.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The total for 5 PCBs and 2 boards assembled from JLC-PCB is $47.05
The high cost is due to the use of high quality output capacitors and power supply filtering capacitors
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
This was challenging because this was my first ever PCB design. The main challenge was getting to know EasyEDA and I hope to switch to Kicad in the future.
