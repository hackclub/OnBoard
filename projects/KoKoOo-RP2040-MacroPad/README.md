# RP2040-Zero Super Macropad

An RP2040-Zero Based Macropad with LEDs, Rotary Encoder, Vibration Motor & OLEDs. 

## Cost

It is going to cost USD 42.23 dollars including 2 PCBA and shipping. The microcontroller RP2040-Zero and OLED costs are not included as I will order my own. 

## Challenges
The main challenge is sourcing componenets. I have made one before but the JLCPCB PCBA cost for both sides is too expensive. So, I put most of my components on one side.  At first, there were SMD LEDs on the board. However, these LEDs can only assembled with JLCPCB's Standard Assembly. So, I switched to Through Hole LEDS.
