# OdysseyMain

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is our main sensor board for our payload's sensor/data functions for Apex. It measures temperature, pressure, gyroscopic data, and time.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$14.20

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Routing took forever because SMDs are annoying. Learned some good PCB practices and racked up some hours for Apex.
