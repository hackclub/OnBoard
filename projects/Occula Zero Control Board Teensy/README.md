# Occula Zero (Control Board)

I've been working on making a point-and-shoot camera with a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. Being a camera, it needs a shutter button and a status light. When soldering wires and components at home, I have found it to be janky and to break a lot. I decided to design my first PCB without using a tutorial, so I made this! This is a revision of an older project, and it is much smaller and fully featured this time. It has a double action shutter button and a slide switch.

It should cost $3.

The small size (16x12mm) made it a challenge to route, but I got the hang of it after a while.
