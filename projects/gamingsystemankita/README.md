# YOUR PROJECT NAME

It's for a little gaming thing I'm planning on making. This helps with making a board and system design that's easy to use!

Cost is $52.67 for 5. 

Having a circuit beforehand (in the video) helped a lot with my own circuit. I also added some other features so it can charge. This was a lot easier to do already having something of a circuit.
