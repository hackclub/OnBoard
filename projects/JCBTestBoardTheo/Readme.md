<!-- My board uses electric components like resistors and capacitors. We are making a light chaser where lights light up one after the other. Mine will bright up red and white lights. -->

<!-- $65.92 -->

<!-- It was a bit challenging to make my maple leaf look like the leaf of the Canadian flag which was my design but I figured out I could use symmetry. The colors I used for my lights were red and white from the flag. -->
