# Theo-PCB

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
We are making a light chaser and printing out a PCB or Printed Circuit Board. Our board will use a light to create a line of lights turning on and off. 

<!-- How much is it going to cost? --> 
$69.19

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
My design involved a Canadian flag since I am Canadian. I used red and white lights with a red board but making the design was challenging, especially to recreate the actual flag. The symmetry feature helped me.
