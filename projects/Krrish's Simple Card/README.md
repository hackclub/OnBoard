# Krrish's Minimalist Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
A business card that has a LED, a NFC tag, and simple text. I want to connect my NFC to my github (or website if i make one).
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$ 20.11
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
While I was creating the board, I realized that I couldnt connect my NFC tag to the antennae using the front copper plate, as other wires were obstructing any clear path for a short circuit free board. So, using some research, I used the back plate wires to connect it to the antennae, which worked fine.
