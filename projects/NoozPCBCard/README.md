# Nooz's PCB Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
Personal hacker card planned to link to personal commission sites. It wires 2 LEDs in parallel as a fun addition to the tutorial, and has a boatload of graphics on the card.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$46.07 USD

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I spent a lot of time looking over other similiar designs to get an idea for how to wire the boards, given this is my first ever PCB design. Everyone in the slack was super helpful with addressing my concerns!
