# tobydio - a breakout board for developing with DAC and ADC ICs

A semi-assembled board to develop with DAC and ADC from chip makers like TI. Featuring a line in and line out 3.5mm headphone jack to receive and output sound signal, pin headers to interface with microcontrollers, and awesome art. 

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

Cost: $33.87
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
This is my fourth pcb ever. I developed this during my pixeldust ysws where I wanted to incorporate some audio system in my project and this is one way for me to test subsystems. I learned how to find and source parts from suppliers like DigiKey, LCSC. I also learned how to get symbols, footprints, and models to help my development process.
