# Alex's Amazing NFC Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I made my very own NFC card using a tutorial on Hack Club.
I uses an NFC chip in order to be used for wireless transmissions of information.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
10 cards cost $28.31 on JLCPCB with shipping costs to Canada included.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I had fun learning to design my first PCB and personalizing my NFC card. 
I'm looking forward to continuing on my PCB-learning journey! :)
