# Raja's Heat Board

It is a controller for a heat board that is used to solder down SMD components.

This board is really cheap to manufacture with assembly of 5 boards it only costs about 85$

This is my first time working with a embedded atmega chip design so I was obviously nervous but in the end with the help of the official arduino datasheet I was able to design this very board.
