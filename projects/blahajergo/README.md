# Blahajboard
## Summary
A wireless 56-key split ortholinear keyboard named after everyone's favorite shark. 

The main project repository can be found here https://github.com/chinh4thepro/blahajergo.

## Plan
The keyboard will use the nice!nano v2 (or any other compatible MCU) using the nRF52840 microcontroller. It'll be equipped with kalih choc v1 hotswap sockets, and oled displays. The board costs ~50 USD with the cheapest shipping selected and ~18 dollars without shipping. I plan to make the case utilizing 3d printing or stacked lazer cut acrylic sheets.

## Design
I had designed a different keyboard PCB before hand, but it was a while back and I wanted to try something different. So I decided on a split ortholinear keyboard for fun.
