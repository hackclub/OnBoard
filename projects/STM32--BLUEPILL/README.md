# STM32--BLUEPILL
## A version of the STM32 "Blue pill" microcontroller with a little bit of my own spin on it!
##### The programmable microcontroller STM32 "Blue pill" was taken out of circulation a while back, however, it's community kept it alive by making dev boards of it and teaching others how to make them, so I followed a tutorial to make it. After that, I decided to make some chanegs. For example, In the original schems the board makes use of a Micro USB, however, I decided to use a USB-C. This board should make use of the USB to be programmable and run custom code, allowing use of peripherals and other external devices.

## Plan
##### Â£27.59 **Not including Tax or Shipping.**

## Design
##### During the design process, the tutorial I was using was using an older version of KiCad, this was mainly what made me run into a lot of issues as the footprint for the STM32 MCU seemed to change over the versions a bit, however, I managed to work my way around it. In addition to this, finding a correct FB for the VA signal conversion was pretty hard too. Luckily, for all of the issues I faced I had a few people that I know online to help me. :)
