# Rowans Macropad

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am making a macroboard that will help automate the daily tasks that I do during coding. 
It uses an AtMega32u4 microcontroller with a 3x3 matrix.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
5 PCBs plus 2 assembled boards will cost $64.91 before shipping, and $88.26 after shipping fees.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
This was my first time designing a board/circuit, so I had to do a lot of research for a minimal-useable AtMega32u4 circuit. 
After that, I had to figure out how to make the whole board cost-effective, as my initial design was $156.
