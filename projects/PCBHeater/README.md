<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am making a PCB that will use nichrome wire to heat up a chamber in a weather balloon payload. I will solder on a BME280 sensor, SD card reader, and wires to connect the nichrome wire to the PCB
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$2 for the board, $19.80 for board with shipping.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I designed this PCB at New England Sci Tech for a stratoscince class. I have needed a lot of help from the instructors because this is my fist time making a PCB!
