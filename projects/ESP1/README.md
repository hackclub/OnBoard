# ESP

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

A version of the esp used for a school project. It is basically a glorified esp. lol.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

Around $110, but the $100 grant should be fine. 

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->

Took a long time. lol
