# haleysbusiness card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am making a business card for my small jewelry and crochet small business. It has a QR code on the front and LED.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It is going to cost $20.58.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Because this is my first time designing a board, finding out where everything is was a large challenge from me. Being able to use the tutorial with the video and pictures to guide me really helped me.
