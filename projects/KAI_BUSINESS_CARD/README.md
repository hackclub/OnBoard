# Hacker Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

I built my first PCB with the help of the hacker club tutorial. I added a qr code, urls and some designs. It transfers a url wirelessly on tap.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

It costs $2 - $4 ($2 for me because I got the coupon code).

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->

A little bit challenging to get started because there's so much going on. Sometimes only a few layers would be on and I'd be really confused. It was fun to make though!
