I created a board that spices up a normal gift tag that you would use on a present/gift. 
It can be programmed to show different patterns of lights and adds a nice touch to whatever its attached to. This is for the Hacky Holidays event!

## Cost
This board costs about $30 without shipping, but that is without the microcontroller and two CR2032 battery holders on the bottom of the PCB. They will be bought seperately to save over 50+ dollars on JLCPCB fees bruh.

## Design Process
I first start sketching a few ideas i have for the hacky holidays event. I went with a gift tag and started iterating on it a bit more, and was constrained to the parts list in slack which was kind of hard. The worst part was trying to make my board cost less on JLCPCB. It all worked out though and my design turned out awesome.
