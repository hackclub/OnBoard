# Superflat

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

A super flat PG1316 keyboard - heavily inspired by mikefive and bayleaf, but aimed to make it even more compact and flat.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

Current PCB & PCBA price comes out at 65$! I will also shell out some money to buy additional parts :(

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->

Loved designing this! Had to learn how to make USB connections correctly, lipo charging circuit and bluetooth etc.

V2 comming soon (tm)
