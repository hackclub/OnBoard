# Kippie's hackercard

I made a hacker card with a nfc chip on it. It's supposed to be like a bussiness card, when you scan the nfc tag you will be directed to my Github page.

5 units cost 2 dollars, so 40 cents per unit.

So i'm very new to pcb designing and at the end there were traces missing so i didnt know what to do, luckily someone in #electronics could help me :)
