# Framework Laptop IR Module

This is a module for the [Framework](https://frame.work) line of laptops that adds infrared support. It can both transmit and recieve, and has the ability to capture generic signals for analysis, and read and decode most standard remotes, which can then control functions on the laptop. This can allow, for instance, one to use an exising infrared remote to control media playback on the laptop, when it is connected to a TV in a Home Theater PC (HTPC) setup. I'm hoping to get the cost for it down to less than $25 per board, maybe even less than $10, although I'm currently focusing on getting the board to actually work before cutting cost.
