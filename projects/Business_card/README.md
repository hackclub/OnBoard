# My business card 

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am trying to make an NFC business card so that I can give my info to people easier and in a cooler way.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It will cost $19.06 including the $9 coupon I will apply to it
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
My design process mainly followed the given tutorial (https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card), however I got stuck when looking for unrouted traces as there was 2 different blue lines and I was not sure how to get rid of the larger one; it helped when I finally read it was just the thin blue line.
