<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I made my board in the shape of an Among Us character. It has a row of LEDs across the top that are supposed to chase in a line at a rate that can be varied using the variable resistor.
I made this as part of a high school class where for one part they taught us how to make a PCB using EasyEDA and actually get it made using this Hack Club grant. 

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The subtotal from JLCPCB is $27.82 for 5 boards (I don't know how to reduce it to one board)
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The hardest part was using EasyEDA, especially trying to assign specific components to the symbols. It was pretty annoying. For something with "Easy" in its name, it was intially pretty frusturating to use.
