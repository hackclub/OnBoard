# USB C Hub

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am making a USB C Hub, which supports USB 2.0 speeds and includes 4 female USB C ports, one of which is used for connecting to a PC.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Approximately 55 dollars with shipping for the 5 assembled pcbs. I could make the pcb bigger, which would allow me to order only one pcb assembled.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
