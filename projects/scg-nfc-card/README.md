# SCG NFC Card

My board will be a business card sized NFC card that helps me find customers and promote my business. Instead of having my customers type out a long URL and such, I can use my NFC card to quickly direct them to my website. These cards will come in handy no matter where in the world I am.

My board currently costs $21.87 USD with assembly.
