# The 2NAC Business Hub

Description:\n
USB Hubs are awesome, but as times are changing, we can't really be limited to **only 2 USB-A ports** can we? I added 2 extra USB Type-C Ports in the mix (supporting data transfer as I connected the D+ and D- pins) to the base USB hub, taking full advantage of the microprocessor.
NFCs... are also cool, but just one? I compressed the USB Hub and already existing NFC tag to add ANOTHER NFC tag!
And finally, the board also contains buttons, some doing nothing while some light up a wonderful data tree, for times when you need a simple fidget toy (battery needed).
Perfect for promoting yourself to employers, being an actual useful PCB, and having a bit of a stress reliever, all in one.
2NAC: 2 NFCs, 2 USB-As, 2 Type-Cs. In a Hub!

Cost:
Costs $93.51 for the total package in JLCPCB.
- $77.71 Total PCBs (and some assembly) cost
- $15.80 shipping costs

Design Process:
- I took inspiration from the USB Hub but found it lacking, so I took advantage of the remaining 2 slots to add Type C ports (since my laptop only had one) with data transfer support.
- As for the NFCs, funny enough other than vehicle RFIDs, I never ever touched an NFC tag ever in my life yet, much more interact with it. So, I found just one tag lacking and wanted one more!
- For the extra lighting and buttons, to be honest I wanted more fun features like LEDs on plug or Linux on board or a 2FA key like yubikeys, but lacked budget, knowhow, and most of all, space. Thus, I settled with simple fidget stuff!
- Design wise, I wanted it to be actually interesting and show me for me, instead of just being a boring "wow okay PCB business card", so I attached drawings at the back and a QR code that leads to a wonderful YT video (rickroll)

Challenges? Excluding budget, I lack know-how. I really want to learn more PCBs now since they can REALLY do a lot. I found so many interesting projects in the project folder I WANTED to give a shot at but lacked experience.

Maybe someday I too will have Linux on a Card!
