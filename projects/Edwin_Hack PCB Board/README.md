# Edwin's PCB NFC Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I'm making my very first PCB as a NFC business card. It has images designed for both sides as well as a QR code and some text (my GitHub username and a link to my Github). 

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It is going to cost a total of $19.72 USD (not including shipping fee).

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I started by using [the wonderful tutorial made by Maggie J. Liu](https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card) then watched some youtube videos and read technical documents about NFC. It takes some time but was fun to learn how to make your own NFC PCB.
