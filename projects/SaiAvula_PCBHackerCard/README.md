# SaiAvula_PCBHackerCaard

<!-- "Thanks to @Maggie for helping me out with doing this, For this project, I designed a PCB card using a NFC chip, Its a really cool project and with this, I can program it to to open up a message whenever I tap it on someone's screen"-->

<!-- "Normally it would cost me 2 dollars because of JCLPCB's offer but I also wanted it to be assembled to it is going to cost me $19.69" -->

<!-- "For my design process, I started off by creating a schematic for the project ad that worked out well. After that I converted it to PCB format and tried routing it. However there was an error so I had to manually route 1 path but in the end everything worked out. "-->
