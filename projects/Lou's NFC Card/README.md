# LOU'S HELLO KITTY NFC CARD :) 

- I made an NFC Hacker card. It's going to be my paper-less version of a business card :) I really like it b/c it's personalised.
- It's going to be $37.38 (Everything is in US Dollars); $11.64 for the PCBs and $25.74 for the Shipping to Kenya. 
- I used the video on the Onboard website which was super helpful and explanatory. My main issue was a little bit with getting the NFC parts but #electronics helped out loads!
