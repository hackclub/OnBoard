# Pi-Day Pie PCB Keychain

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I made a keychain in the shape of a pie. It has 3 LEDs that will light up if the switch is flipped. I made this for Pi-day (3/14)

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$26.16 (not including shipping)

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The first PCB workshop I attended was at Spark where Maggie was explaining how to make a Hacker Card. At Summit, Max's workshop gave me more exposure to PCBs and his workshop in the Slack channel helped me experiment with different parts. 
For Blossom, I worked on a PCB keychain and with each of my previous experiences, I was able to add an SVG as an outline, understand layers, circuits (from Physics class), and how to pick parts.
