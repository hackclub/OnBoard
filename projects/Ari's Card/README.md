# Ari's Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is my first PCB, it is a card with NFC and some fun graphics. I am planning to use it as a fun and visually interesting way to have data on a card.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It will cost **$38.49 total:**
* $19.69 for the 5 PCBs
* $18.80 for shipping

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I mainly followed the tutorial by Maggie Liu (linked above) which was extremely helpful. At the last stage I just decided to customize it based on what I thought would look good on the card.
