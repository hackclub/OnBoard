# Eminent's USB-C Hub

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
It is a USB Hub with one male USB-C, two female USB-Cs, and two female USB-As. I plan to use it on my computer to charge many different devices at once.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$94.90~
I would love to bring down the cost, but I am not sure how it is possible. The USB-C male piece requires Standard building, which instantly increases the cost by around $30. However, I played around with a few other USB-C male pieces, but they still needed the standard building.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
This was my first ever PCB, so I was originally planning on following the HackClub tutorial for USB Hubs. However, halfway through, I decided to add USB-C pieces, because a USB-A hub would be nearly useless for my computer. Initially, I tried to incorporate USB 3.0 (obviously without sufficient research on the topic). However, I later reverted back to the USB 2.0 and designed my USB hub with that. I consulted many sources online (including the Slack) and even screenshotted my schematic to show ChatGPT at times. If I had just followed the original tutorial, it would have taken me around an hour or two. With all my outside research, this project took roughly 15-20 hours.
