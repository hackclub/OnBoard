# Magic 8 Ball

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
The goal of this project is to create a jam that will show people who are familiar with assembling electronics in breadboards how to take their projects and design PCB's for them. My magic 8 ball project, incorporates a OLED display, accelerometer, buzzer, and pi pico into a magic 8 ball shaped board that when shoken will act like a Magic 8 Ball.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The boards only cost $2.43 but shipping is more expensive at $18.80
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
