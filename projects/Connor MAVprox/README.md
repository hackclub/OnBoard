# MAVprox

#### The MAVprox
The MAVprox is a magnetic hall effect sensor. It has the sensor on one end, and has a  LED that will 
light up when it senses a magnet as well as emmitting voltage back. We designed it because we wanted a 
hall effect sensor that would be on the same plane of motion that the magnet would be moving in rather
than in a perpendicular plane.

##### How much is it going to cost?
Both sets of boards will cost around $10 total.
##### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped?
On the MAVterm I added a mounting hole on the back of it because, though it will not mount onto something,
a 3d-printed case will be designed for it so that it does not get damaged. The same kind of idea was implemented
ont he MAVprox, but at first I  put slots rather than holes so that the team could fine tune the exact placement of
the sensor, but in the end, I chose to put just holes, and put slots on the 3d-printed cover in order to make it nicer.
