# DHT22 probe

## Description
My friend tasked me to create an alternative to CraftComputing's Axe Effect temperature probe (https://www.craftcomputing.com/product/axe-effect-temperature-sensor-beta-/1?cs=true&cst=custom), I designed this board.
It features a modular system to allow different boards, but it's mainly for the Raspberry Pi Pico WH.
## Cost
The probe's PCB costs around $4.70 USD, I will not be using JLCPCB's Assembly service as I will be hand soldering the parts myself.
