# YOUR PROJECT NAME

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This sensor plate consist of 36 hall-effect sensors; 32 sensors for personel identification and 4 sensors for company identification.
With 32 sensors devoted to personel identification, there are 4,294,967,296 possible combinations for a personel identifier, similarly with 4 sensors devoted to company identification, there are 16 possible combinations for a company identifier. (could be increased up to 256 with minor modifications.)
We plan to use this system to allow or deny access to a location (business, school, site, etc), to do so, we will use these sensors to create a binary code 32 digits long and a second binary code 4 digits long for the personel identifier and company identifier respectively throug the use of an Arduino MEGA 2560.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I enjoy working my way through problems on my own. I find I learn the most and I am most fulfilled with my work that way. This involved me reading through the EasyEDA tool usage and recomendations.
However, I was challenged quite often. I had issues converting the textbook knowledge into practical knowledge. Not only that, but I made a lot of mistakes.
This is mainly due to the fact that neither my teachers nor my father had ever used EasyEDA, let alone designed a PCB. This was my first time, and I rather enjoyed it. 
Even all of the infuriating mistakes, as in the end I learned just a little bit more.
