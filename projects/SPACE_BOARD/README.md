# Space Board

I created a space hackercard, it is setup with a dynamic qr code along with a light ( that will be configured to confirm when actions take place like NFC scan ) and NFC card. I based the art design off of Space, and used minimal text so that it can be configured for a wide variety of applications.

The pricing is $21.78 USD in total for PCB / Assembly / Shipping.

I first tried doing it in KiCad, but then I had to import every library so I ended up switching to EasyEDA because they already had every part in there ( or in the easily accesible public section ). The hardest part was figuring out the new UI and how to use everything. After I finished my board design Aiden on Slack helped a lot with all my questions.
