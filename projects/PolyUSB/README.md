# PolyUSB

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
PolyUSB is a USB hub PCB that will allow me to connect more USB-A devices to my laptop.
This is a real problem I have - I can't fit all the dongles and drives I need with just the 2 USB-A ports on my laptop.
With PolyUSB, I'll be able to effectively turn 2 ports into 4.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It will cost $53.42 (plus tax), with the board and assembly costing $27.85 and $25.57 for shipping.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The PCB was designed in KiCAD, with the help of the [USB Hub jam](https://jams.hackclub.com/batch/usb-hub),
[this guide to making PCBs in KiCAD](https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/kicad-tutorial/),
and [this Python script to import JLCPCB/LCSC components into KiCAD](https://github.com/uPesy/easyeda2kicad.py).
Getting started with KiCAD and the routing was a bit of a challenge, but it helped me learn more and advance my knowledge and skills
after my first PCB project, polycard.
