<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
My board which I made in EasyEDA is meant to represent a smiley face. It's quite basic...

It will cost $22.72 in total.
