# Slimeball v4 (the final iteration)

The Slimeball project has been a personal project to create a cheap SlimeVR tracker in a small form factor. (a circle 5 centimeters in diameter)
I have been working on it for about a month now, with 5 or 6 different PCB iterations and 3 total schematics.
It is similar to the [FletchVR](https://github.com/hackclub/OnBoard/blob/9d2c70aaeaf6d3fc40ac4b730c586b43462e415e/projects/FletchVR/README.md) project that was also submitted to OnBoard, but the difference is that the Slimeball is a full board with all the components, and FletchVR is a carrier board that allows breakout boards to communicate.

The total is $98.16, covering PCB manufacturing, assembly, and shipping.

I think the biggest challenge about this project was deciding on a battery type. I had many different options, whether it be rechargable or disposable, and even what size of rechargable or disposable. In the end, I decided that I am going to use li-ion batteries since they come in many sizes and have dense energy storage.
