# mukul0x08-hacker-card

I made an nfc card folling th hacker-card tutorial found on the hack club website with intention to learn pcb design. I have learnt how to use easy eda and find resouces to help me.


It costs $40.65.


Since the tutorial used older versions of easyEDA, it was really hard to follow the instructions.
