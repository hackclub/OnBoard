# CamMa-NFC-Card
<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I made an NFC card which has my contact info and a design of stars. It will let you tap to a phone and fill out a contact automatically.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$22.58
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
A challenge was avoiding short circuits (I think I had several), but with some research I understood them better and avoided them.
