# Ishbhir's Stylophone

It is a simple stylophone which can be connected to a piezo buzzer or a 2-3ohm speaker. It is powered by the 555 timer IC which is very cheap

It costs 36$ and 5 boards get assembled for that price :)

I had trouble making the solder pads for the circuit which would act like the plate for stylophone. I will try to fix it more in next iterations too.
