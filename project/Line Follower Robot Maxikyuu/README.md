# Autonomous Sumo & Line Follower Robot PCB

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
Hello! I'm making a line following robot, which will drive and follow black lines on a given race track/course. 
The robot will try to follow this line as accurately and fast as possible to reach the desired goal. 
However, it can also turn into an autonomous sumo robot, where it will drive in random directions until it finds an
opponent and try to push them out of an arena using an ultrasonic sensor!

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The board will cost $9.00 + $17.50 shipping cost, bringing the total to $26.50.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
First, I selected the components that was best suited and easily available. I'm making this robot for my computer engineering course,
so I could only use the motors available. My power supply is a 6xAA battery holder, providing ~9V, which will help make my motors drive
pretty fast. Some challenges that I had with this project was picking the right components, arranging them efficiently on the pcb, and 
time, since I only have 1 week until I have to submit (lol). However, by watching some Youtube videos on PCB design, I was able to improve
my skills at picking, arranging, and routing components! (I reccomend Phil's Lab )
