1. When recieving your grant and you're ready to pay for your PCB, make sure to select a coupon at checkout! This way you will have more money to build more PCBs in the future.
2. Try to buy multiple designs at the same time to save on shipping!
3. Don't forget to submit your invoice/receipt to Hack Club bank after paying!!!!
4. Select the "assemble" option when ordering! This way everything will come assembled.
5. Use Lead-free HASL!
6. When ordering, you may get an alert that some parts "unselected". This usually can be ignored.
7. You can design as many boards as you want, as long as the total cost doesn't go over $100.
8. While generating your gerber files in EasyEDA, always chose the One-Click Order option to get a $8 discount. It's more efficient and hassle free, generating and submitting the BOM, Pick&Place, and Gerber files automatically.
