# Shipping Tips

How to minimize your PCB shipping costs so you can make the most out of your OnBoard grant.
If you have any general tips or info for your country, please let us know.

## General

- Sometimes selecting a thinner PCB (going from 1.6mm to 1.0mm) can make shipping cheaper by reducing the board weight. Try different options and see if the cost increase of the PCB and decrease of shipping cancel out. Alternatively, some manufacturers charge extra for thicknesses other than 1.6mm - if your assembly is costing more than expected, this could be te reason.

## United States

- From JLCPCB, use Global Direct Standard Line for the cheapest shipping, although it might take a week or two to arrive.
- For small boards, when you don't want assembly, OSHPark could be cheaper. Their boards are more expensive but shipping is free.

## India

- From JLCPCB, always use Air Registered Mail. There can be very high customs fees ($30-$50) on other carriers, and OnBoard won't pay for it.
