# 4 WAY USB HUB

**A usb hub that allows users with one usb-a port to now use 4! Inspired from my constant need for more ports when working with my FRC robot 😅. 
It should help those of us who need to connect to a bunch of things at the same time, even if we don't have the hardware capabilities in our laptops to do it.**
<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

While the hardware costs $29.84, the shipping is $22.80, which is a grand total of $52.64 before tax.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

I've never made a PCB but I've made circuits for arduinos and worked with wiring FRC robots so my main challenge was just getting used to doing it online. 
I was also really stressed out about accidently choosing the wrong option whenn I was creating the order. 😰
