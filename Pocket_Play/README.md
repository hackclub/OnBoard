# Pocket Play

This is a pocket sized device inspired by some designs I've seen online. It allows a user to play mini games, such as snake, tetris, and stacker. It'll cost around $80 total for manufacturing and shipping (15 boards). I am so excited for my first project, and I look forward for more to come. So grateful for this oppourtunity!
